== Using caches

=== Using a cache
		
A cache allows reusing objects which are expensive to create. If you load on object into memory, you can think
of this as a cache for the object.
For example, if you downloading images from
the
Internet
to
display
them in a
list
you
should hold them in memory to avoid
that you download them
several
times.
		
At some point you need to recycle some of your objects, otherwise you run out of memory. A good approach to do
this, is to recycle the objects which have not been used the longest in your application.
		
The Android platform provides the
`LruCache`
class, as of API 12 (or in the support-v4 library). The
`LruCache`
class provides a
_least recently used cache _
(LRU cache)
cache implementation.
A LRU cache
keeps track of the usage of its
members. It has a given size and if this
size is
exceeded, it removes
the
items
which have
not
be accessed the longest. This behavior is
depicted in the
following
graphic.

The following example code demonstrates a possible implementation of the `LruCache` class for caching images.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/cache/ImageCache.java[]
----
		
Its usage is simple and demonstrated by the following example code.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/cache/ImageCacheUsage.java[]
----		

For determining the initial size of the cache, it is good practice to determine the size based on the total memory available on the device.
For determining the available memory you can the `MemoryClass`. 
This is demonstrated by the following code.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/cache/Size.java[]
----		

=== Cleaning up your cache
		
As of API 14 you can override the `onTrimMemory()` method in Android components. 
This method is called by the Android system asking you to cleanup your memory in case the Android system requires resources for foreground processes.
