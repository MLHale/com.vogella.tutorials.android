== Exercise: Create an Android library module

Our library project will contain the data model and a method to get the number of instances. 
The library provides access to (fake) RSS data. 
An _RSS_ document is an XML file which can be used to publish blog entries and news. 

=== Create library module
		
For Android Studio each library is a module. 
To create a new library module in Android Studio, select menu:File[New Module] and select `Android Library`.

Use _com.example.android.rssfeedlibrary_ as module name and _Rssfeed Library_ as library name.

If prompted for a template select that no activity should be created. 
As a result Android Studio shows another module.

=== Create the model class
		
Create an
`RssItem`
class which can store data of an RSS entry.
		
Generate the getters and setter, the constructor and a
`toString()`
method. The result should look like the following class:
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/net/RssItem.java[]
----		
	
=== Create instances
		
Create a new class called `RssFeedProvider` with a static method to return a list of `RssItem` objects.
This method does currently only return test data.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/net/RssFeedProvider.java[]
----		
	
=== Define dependency to the library project
		
		
To use the library add it as a dependency in your project select menu:File[Project Structure]. 
Select the _app_ entry.
Switch to the `Dependencies` tab and select `Module dependencies` via the + sign.

=== Use library project to update detailed fragments
		
Update the `updateDetail` method in your `MyListFragment` class to use the `RssFeedProvider` provider.
This is only test code.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/net/MyListFragment.java[]
----		

<1> Updated method
	
=== Validate implementation
		
Start your application and ensure that the `toString` value of the list of RssItems is displayed in the detailed fragment.

NOTE: The list is currently generated randomly every time you press the button.
