== What are Drawables?

A
_Drawable_
resource is a general concept for a graphic which can
be drawn. The
simplest case is a graphical file (bitmap), which would be represented
in Android
via a
`BitmapDrawable`
class.

Every Drawable is stored as individual files in one of the
_res/drawable_
folders. Typically you would store bitmaps for different resolutions
in the
_-mdpi_,
_-hdpi_,
_-xhdpi_,
_-xxhdpi_
subfolders of
_res/drawable_. The ADT project creation wizard
creates these
folders by default. If
these bitmaps are provided in different folder, the Android system
selects the correct one automatically based on the device
configuration.

If you do not
provide bitmaps for all supported resolutions, the
Android system
scales
the closest fit up or down. This is typically
undesired as the bitmap might get blury.

In addition to graphical files, Android supports XML drawables
and 9-patch graphics. XML drawables are used to describe shapes
(color, border, gradient), state, transitions and more.

9-patch graphics are used to define which part of a graphic
should be
stretched if the
view which uses this graphic is larger than
the graphic.

Drawables can also be written in Java code. Every object which
implements
`Drawable`
can be used as a
`Drawable in code.`
