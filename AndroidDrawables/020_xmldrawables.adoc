== XML Drawables

=== Shape Drawables

Shape Drawables are XML files which allow to define a geometric
object with colors, borders and gradients which can get assigned to
`Views`. The advantage of using XML Shape Drawables is that they
automatically adjust to the correct size.

The following listing shows an example of a Shape Drawable.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/drawable/myshape.xml[]
----

You could for example assign that drawable to the background
property of your
layout.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/drawable/main.xml[]
----

=== State Drawables

State drawables allow to define states. For each state a
different
drawable can get assigned to the
`View`. For example the
following
defines different drawables for a button
depending on its
state.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/drawable/state.xml[]
----

=== Transition Drawables

Transition Drawables allow to define transitions which can be
triggered in the coding.

[source,xml]

include::res/drawable/transition.xml[]

[source,txt]

include::res/drawable/trans.txt[]
