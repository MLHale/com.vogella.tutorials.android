== Resources and Android device configurations

Android devices comes in a variety of different configurations in the sense of size, screen pixel density, language settings, etc.
Android supports the automatic selection of resources fitting to the device configuration.

For this, you provide different resources in pre-defined sub-folders in the `res` directory.
The suffix name of a sub-folder defines the device configuration for which it is valid, e.g., orientation, resolution, languages). 

=== Important resource qualifiers

==== Screen density

		
Screens of Android devices are different in terms of resolution and in terms of density of the pixels on the screen.
In case of a different screen densities the same length of a user interface component consists of a different amount of pixels.
		
For example, if you specify the pixels directly, you might get the following result on a device with a relatively low number of pixels.

image::deviceindependendpixels10.png[Device Independent pixels on low resolution devices,pdfwidth=40%]

Using the same number of pixels on a device with more pixels might lead to an unusable graphical user interface.
		
image::deviceindependendpixels20.png[Device independent pixels on low resolution devices,pdfwidth=40%]
		
For this reason you should provide graphical resources, e.g., the laucher and action bar icons in different resolutions. 
This can be done by using resource qualifiers based on the pixel desity.
		
You can use the density as resource qualifier. 
Android support the following selections. 
The baseline is 160 dots per inch (dpi). 
If for example the Android device has 320 dpi, the Drawable from the _drawable-hdpi_ is selected.

.Density resource selector
|===
|Density selector |Equals

|ldpi
|160 dpi x 0.75

|mdpi
|160 dpi

|hdip
|1.5 x 160 dpi = 240 dpi

|xhdpi
|2 x 160 dpi = 320 dpi

|xxhdpi
|3 x 160 dpi = 480 dpi

|xxxhdpi
|4 x 160 dpi = 640 dpi
|===

==== Icon sizes
You should provide your launcher, action bar and notification bar icons in the important five size.
		
.Android icons size
|===
|Icons |mdpi |hdpi |xhdpi |xxhdpi |xxxhdpi

|Launcher icon	
|48 px	
|72 px	
|96 px	
|144 px	
|192 px

|Action bar icon	
|32 px	
|48 px	
|64 px	
|96 px	
|128 px

|Notification icon	
|24 px	
|36 px	
|48 px	
|72 px	
|96 px
|===

The launch icon should also be provide in 512x512 px for the published application in Google Play.
		
	
    
==== Using orientation as resource qualifier
        
Assume, for example, that you want to use a special layout for your activity in landscape mode and that the layout file is called
_activity_main.xml_.
In this case you create the _res/layout-land_ folder and place the new layout file with the same name (_activity_main.xml_) in this folder.
        
==== Android version qualifiers
        
A typical selection you use in your application, is the selection based on Android version, which is based on the `-v[minimum API level]` qualifier. 
For example, this way you can provide different styling and themes based on the Android API revision.
        
A typical example for using this qualifier is to define the styling based on the Android version.
        
==== Width and height related qualifiers
        
Another typical selection is the _smallest available width_ selection or the _available width_ selection. 
The _smallest available width_ is the shortest of the screen's available height and the _available width_ is the actual width based on the orientation of the device.
        
        
The width selection can, for example, be used to provide different layouts based on the width of the device.
This selection is based on `-sw[Number]dp` (Smallest) or `-w[Number]dp` qualifier, where [Number] stands for the number of device independent pixels. 
For example, a 7inch tablet typically has at least 600dp and you could provide layouts for it via the `res/layout-sw600dp/` selector.
        
==== More resource qualifiers
        
The other resource qualifiers are described on the following webpage.
