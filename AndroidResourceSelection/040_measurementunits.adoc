== Defining the size of UI components in layout files
=== Fixed or relative dimensions
		
Android allows you to define the size of user interface components in fixed or relative dimensions in the layout files. 
If you use fixed sized dimensions, e.g., pixels, your user interface may look fine on a certain device, but the button might be too small on other devices with a higher pixel density.
		
It is recommended to always use relative dimensions in your Android application.

=== Using dp as relative dimension

		
The unit of measurement which should be used is `dp`.
		
TIP: `dp` is short for `dip` (device independent pixel). 

`dp` refers to one pixel on an Android device with 160dpi (dots per inch).
This is the density of the first available Android device (G1).
This size is also known asmdpi (medium dots per inch).
		
		
If you specify the size in `dp`, Android automatically scale your user interface component, depending on the device.
		
On a mdpi (a.k.a. medium density) device one `dp` is the same as one pixel. 
A `dp` on ldpi (low density) device is smaller (approx. 120dip), on a hdpi (high density) device is larger (approx. 240dpi). 
Therefore a `dp` occupies approximately the same physical space on every device.
		
You can use `dp` in your resources, e.g., layout files.
		
=== Using sp to scale with the user text preferences
		
If the unit should scale with text preference settings of the user, choose the `sp` unit of measurement. 
This unit is similar to dp, but it is also scaled by the user preference.
		
If the users select to increase the font size in this settings, views which use `sp` are scaled accordingly.
