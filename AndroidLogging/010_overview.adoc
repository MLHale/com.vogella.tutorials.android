=== The log system of Android
	
The Android system uses a centralized system for all logs. 
The application programmer can also write custom log messages. 
The tooling to develop Android applications allows you to define filters for the log statements you are interested in.

=== Create log statements
(((BuildConfig)))
To write log statements, you use the
`android.util.Log`
class with the
`Log.v()`,
`Log.d()`,
`Log.i()`,
`Log.w()`,
`Log.e()`
or
`Log.wtf()`
method. They are sorted by relevance with
`Log.i()`
being the least important one.
The first
parameter of these methods is the category
and
the second
is the
message.
    

    
Typically you create a `Constants` interface in your Android application and provide your log category as a field.

Android advises that a deployed application should not contain logging code. 
The Android development tools provide the `BuildConfig.DEBUG` flag for this purpose. 
This flag will be automatically set to `false` if you export the Android application for deployment. 
During development it will be set to `true`, therefore allowing you to see your logging statements during development.
    
    
The following example show how to write an error log message.
