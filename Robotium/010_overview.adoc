== Robotium
	
_Robotium_
is an extension of the Android test framework and was
created
to make
it
easy to write
user interface tests for
Android
applications.
Robotium
tests inherit from
`ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2`
and
allows you to define test
cases
across
Android
activities.
	
NOTE: Robotium tests perceive the application under test as black box, i.e., it only interacts with the user interface and not via the internal code of the application.

The homepage of Robotium is currently located under the following URL:
http://code.google.com/p/robotium/[Robotium homepage]
but is moving to
https://github.com/RobotiumTech/[Robotium at Github].
	
Robotium extends the Android test framework to make it simpler to
write tests. The main class for testing with Robotium
is
`Solo`.
	
`Solo`
is initialized with the
instrumentation of the testcase and
the first
activity to test.
