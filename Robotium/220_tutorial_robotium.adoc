=== Exercise: Writing Robotium tests

Create an Android project called
_com.vogella.android.test.robotium.target_. Display three buttons in the first
activity.
If the first button is
pressed, start another activity which displays
a
list.

=== Create test project and add Robotium

Create a test project called
_com.vogella.android.test.robotium.targetTest_. Create a folder called
`libs`
and place the Robotium
`JAR`
file into it.

TIP:If you place the
`JAR`
file in this folder, the Android
tooling for Eclipse adds it
automatically to the build
path of your project. Putting
the
`JAR`
into a folder with a different
name, frequently
causes a
`ClassNotFoundExeception`
for the Solo class.

[[tutorial_robotium3]]
=== Create test project and add Robotium library

Define the following test class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/robotium/SimpleActivityTest.java[]
----

[[tutorial_robotium4]]
=== Fix your application

Assume that the test is your specification and adjust your
Android application
until the test passes correctly.
