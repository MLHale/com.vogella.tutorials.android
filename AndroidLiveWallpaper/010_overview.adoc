== Overview

=== Live Wallpapers
		
_Live Wallpapers_
are animated, interactive backgrounds for the
Android home screen. A
live wallpaper is similar to other Android
applications and can use
most of the same functionality.
		
=== How to create a live wallpaper
		
To create a live wallpaper, you need to create an XML file which
describes your wallpaper. This file should contain a description of
the application and can contain a preview and a link to a preference
_activity_
Activity which allow to customize the live wallpaper.
		
You also create a
_service_
which
must extend the
`WallpaperService`
class. This class is the base class for all live
wallpapers in
the
system. You must implement the
`onCreateEngine()`
method
and return
an
object of type
`android.service.wallpaper.WallpaperService.Engine`. This
objects
handles the
lifecycle
events,
animations and drawings
of
the
wallpaper. The
`Engine`
class defines the life
cycle methods, as for example
`onCreate()`,
`onSurfaceCreated()`,
`onVisibilityChanged()`,
`onOffsetsChanged()`,
`onTouchEvent()`
and
`onCommand()`.
		
The
service
requires
the permission
`android.permission.BIND_WALLPAPER`
and
must be
registered via an
intent-filter for the
`android.service.wallpaper.WallpaperService`
action.
		
You should also enter in the
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file of the application
that your
application uses the
`android.software.live_wallpaper`
feature. This
will prevent
that your wallpaper can be
installed on
devices
which do
not support
live wallpapers.
		
=== Intent to set the wallpaper
		
You can use an
_Intent_
to set the Wallpaper.
