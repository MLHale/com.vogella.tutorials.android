== Traceview

=== Introduction
		
_Traceview_
is a graphical
viewer to see logs created by an Android
application.
Via
_Traceview_
you can measure the performance of your application to
identify
performance problems.
		
_Traceview_
is located as standalone tool in the
_tools_
folder of your Android SDK installation folder and it also integrated
into Eclipse via the Android Developer Tools
(ADT).
		
=== Using Traceview from Android Studio
		
Android Studio supports tracing via the Android Device Monitor. Use
menu:Tools[Android > Android Device Monitor] to open it.
		
To start tracing an application select your application process in
the
`Devices`
view
and
select the
_Start Method Profiling_
button as depicted in the following screenshot.

=== Using TraceView from the command line
		
To start tracing some code put the following
code snippet around
it.
		
[source,txt]
----
include::res/traceview/trace.txt[]
----		
		
The parameter "yourstring" tells the system that it should
store
the
data under "/sdcard/yourstring.trace". To save
data on the
sdcard
your
application needs the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission.
After
running
your application you can
copy the results from the device via
the adb command line tool.
		
[source,txt]
----
include::res/traceview/gettraceview.txt[]
----
		
This will start Traceview which allow you to analyze your
performance data via a graphical way. The DDMS view
has also a trace
button available. This will
trace the running application and does not
require an additional
authorization.
