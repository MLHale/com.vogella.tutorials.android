== Profile GPU rendering

In the
`Developer options`
in the
`Setting`
or your Android device you can activate
_Profile GPU rendering_. With this option the system tracks the time it took to draw the last
128 frames.

After activating this and restarting your application you can get
the information via the following command.

[source,java]
----
include::res/gpu/trace.txt[]
----

To measure the frame rate of your application, e.g. by scrolling
on a list view. In most cases you need to interact with your
application to trigger that it re-draws itself.

In the resulting log, look for a section called
_Profile data in ms_.
