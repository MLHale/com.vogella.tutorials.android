== Layout optimization
	
You should optimize your layout. The following gives an example how to
use
`FrameLayout`
with an
`ImageView`
and one
`TextView`
to create result despicted in the next screenshot. It uses the
possibility to position
the
`TextView`
in the layout and to style parts of its text content differently.

Create a project called
_com.vogella.android.textview.spannablestring_.
	
Add two news styles to your
_styles.xml_
file.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/layoutopt/styles.xml[]
----
	
Create the following layout. 
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/layoutopt/activity_main.xml[]
----	
	
Style your text in the
`TextView`
via separate
`TextAppearanceSpan`
as demonstrated in the following code.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/layoutopt/MainActivity.java[]
----	
	
The resulting layout is much faster than a layout based on
`RelativeLayout`. Also HTML styling was avoid as the HTML parser is relatively
expensive.
