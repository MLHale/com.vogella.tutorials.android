== Exercise: Traceview

=== Create example project

Create an Android application with the top level package called
`com.vogella.android.traceview`.

Add the following key to your
_values/strings.xml_
file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/traceview/strings.xml[]
----

Create the following layout file called
_rowlayout.xml_.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/traceview/rowlayout.xml[]
----

Implement the following
`adapter`
for your
`ListView`.

[source,java]
----
include::res/traceview/MyArrayAdapter.java[]
----

Implement a
`ListView`
in the
_activity_
which shows 1000 random generated strings.

[source,java]
----
include::res/traceview/MainActivity.java[]
----

Add the permission to write on external storage to your
application.

=== Perform trace

Run your application. Afterwards connect to your device via adb
and copy the resulting performance trace to your drive. Analyze the
result.

=== Solve performance problems

Improve the performance based on the measurements of
_Traceview_.
Here are some pointers what to improve.

* Replace the bold styling in the `getView()` method with the corresponding `android:textStyle="bold` attribute in your layout to avoid the
`Html.fromHtml()` call.
* Move the sorting to another place
* Reuse convertView in your Adapter, if not null
* Avoid the findViewById() method call by using the HolderPattern in your ListView

NOTE: The layout is also not optimized. We reuse this exercise in the
exercise for the
_HierarchyView_
