== Developer Settings
	
_Developer Settings_
in your
`Setting`
application of your Android phone allow to set configurations which
simplify the
analysis of your application. For example you can enable
that the touch area is highlighted.
	
If you have a phone with Android 4.2, try going to the About section in the _Settings_ and tap the `Build number` entry 7 times.
	
If you phone does not have this option try using an emulator.
	
In some cases you need to restart the application to make the setting work.
