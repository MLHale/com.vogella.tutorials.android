== Exercise: Hierarchy Viewer
	
Continue to use the same example as in the Traceview Excercise. 
Open the `Hierarchy View` _perspective_ and analyze the view layer.
	
While none of these layout layers is very performance intensive it contains redundant layers and unnecessary views. 
Remove the unnecessary view layers.
