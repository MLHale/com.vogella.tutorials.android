== StrictMode
	
You should avoid performing long running
operations
on the
UI
thread.
This
includes file and network access.
	
To ensure this you can use
_StrictMode_. StrictMode is available as of API 9 (Android
2.3.3) and
allows to
setup thread policies for your
application.
	
Via
_StrictMode_
you can instruct the Android system to crash your application if
it
performs
long running
operations, e.g. I/O
in
the user interface thread.
	
The following code shows how to use
_StrictMode_. As the
_activity_
violates these settings it
will crash.

StrictMode
should only be used
during
development and
not in
your live
application.
