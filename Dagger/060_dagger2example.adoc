== Exercise: Dependency injection with Dagger 2

In this example you use Dagger 2 in a standard Java program managed by Maven.

This exercise can be done via any Java IDE you like, for example the Eclipse IDE with the Maven tooling installed.
Or it can  be developed and compiled via a text editor and the Maven command line. 
If you use Eclipse, ensure to install the http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseMaven/article.html[Eclipse Maven tooling].

=== Create example project for the usage of Dagger 2
		
Create a new Maven project with the `com.vogella.java.dagger2` top level package.
		
=== Define or adjust Maven build file 
		
Adjust your `pom.xml` to the following.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/maven/pom.xml[]
----
		
[[exercise_daggerintro_classes]]

=== Define classes which have a dependency

Define the following two classes which express dependencies. 

[source,java]
----
include::res/maven/User.java[]
----	

[source,java]
----
include::res/maven/BackendService.java[]
----
		
[[exercise_daggerintro_modules]]
=== Define modules which provides dependencies

Define two class which acts as providers for dependencies.  

[source,java]
----
include::res/maven/BackEndServiceModule.java[]
----		

[source,java]
----
include::res/maven/UserModule.java[]
----	
		
[[exercise_daggerintro_components]]
=== Define components

Components define from which modules (or other components) dependencies are provided. 
Dagger 2 uses this interface to generate the accessor class which provides the methods defined in the interface.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/maven/MyComponent.java[]
----		

<1> Method which allows injecting into `BackendServer` for the fields


[[exercise_daggerintro_uses]]
=== Use the generated dagger code

The usage of the generated code is demonstrated by the following test class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/maven/Main.java[]
----	

<1> Fields are not automatically injected hence the method call to inject the fields
