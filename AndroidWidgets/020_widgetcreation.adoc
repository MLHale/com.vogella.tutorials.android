== Creating the Broadcast receiver for the widget

=== Create and configure widget
		
To register a widget, you create a broadcast receiver
with an intent
filter for the
`android.appwidget.action.APPWIDGET_UPDATE`
action.
		
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/config/register.xml[]
----		
		
The receiver
can get a label and icon assigned. These are used
in the list
of
available widgets in the Android launcher.
		
You also specify the meta-data for the widget
via the
`android:name="android.appwidget.provider`
attribute. The configuration file referred by this
metadata
contains
the configuration settings for the
widget.
It contains, for example, the
update interface, the size and
the
initial layout of
the widget.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/config/widget_info.xml[]

=== Available views and layouts
		
A widget is restricted in the
`View`
classes it can use. As layouts you
can
use the
`FrameLayout`,
`LinearLayout`
and
`RelativeLayout`
classes. As views you can use
`AnalogClock`,
`Button`,
`Chromometer`,
`ImageButton`,
`ImageView`,
`ProgressBar`
and
`TextView`.
		
As of Android 3.0 more views are available:
`GridView`,
`ListView`,
`StackView`,
`ViewFlipper`
and
`AdapterViewFlipper`.
These adapter
views
require that you define a
_collection view widget_
which is described later in this {textselfreference}.
		
The only interaction that is possible with the
views
of a
widget
is via
an
`OnClickListener` event.
This
`OnClickListener`
can be registered on a widget and is triggered by the user.
		
=== AppWidgetProvider
		
Your
`BroadcastReceiver`
implementation
typically
extends the
`AppWidgetProvider`
class.
		
The
`AppWidgetProvider`
class implements the
`onReceive()`
method, extracts the required information and calls the
following
widget life cycle methods.
		
As you can add several instances of a widget to the
home screen,
you have life cycle methods which are called only for the
first
instance added / removed to the home screen and others which are
called for every instance of your widget.
		

.Life cycle method
|===
|Method |Description

|`onEnabled()`
|Called the first time an instance of your widget is added to the home screen.

|`onDisabled()`
|Called once the last instance of your widget is removed from the home screen.

|`onUpdate()`
|Called for every update of the widget. Contains the ids of `appWidgetIds` for which an update is needed. 
Note that this may be all of the `AppWidget` instances for this provider, or just a subset of them, as stated in the method's JavaDoc. 
For example, if more than one widget is added to the home screen, only the last one changes (until reinstall).

|`onDeleted()`
|Widget instance is removed from the home screen.
|===

=== Receiver and asynchronous processing

A widget has the same runtime restrictions as a normal
broadcast
receiver, i.e., it has only 5 seconds to finish its processing.
		
A
receive (widget)
should therefore perform
time consuming
operations
in a service
and perform the update of
the
widgets
from
the
service.
