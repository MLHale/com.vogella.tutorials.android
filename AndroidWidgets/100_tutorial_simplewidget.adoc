== Exercise: widget with fixed update interval

=== Target
		
In the following tutorial you create a widget which displays a random
number. This random number is
updated every 30
minutes.
You also
register an
`OnClickListener`
so that the widgets updates once the user clicks on it.
		
The resulting
widget will look like the following.

=== Create project and widget implementation
		
Create a new Android project called
_de.vogella.android.widget.example_
with an activity
in the package
`de.vogella.android.widget.example`.
		
Create a new file
_myshape.xml_
in the
<filename class="directory">/res/drawable_
folder. This file defines the
drawable used as background in the
widget.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/first/myshape.xml[]
----		
		
Define the following
_widget_layout.xml_
file under the
<filename class="directory">res/layout_
folder.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/first/widget_layout.xml[]
----		
		
Create a new resource file called
_widget_info.xml_
via right click on the res folder and by selecting
menu:New[Android resource file].

[source,xml]
----
include::res/first/widget_info.xml[]
----		
		
Create the following receiver class which is
called during
updates.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/first/MyWidgetProvider.java[]
----		
		
Open the
_AndroidManifest.xml_
and register your widget similar to the following listing.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/first/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----		
		
This attribute specifies that the
`AppWidgetProvider`
accepts the
`ACTION_APPWIDGET_UPDATE`
broadcast and specifies the metadata for the widget.
		
=== Validating
		
Deploy your application on your Android device. Once your
application
has been deployed use the
Android
launcher to
install your
new widget on the home screen and test it.
