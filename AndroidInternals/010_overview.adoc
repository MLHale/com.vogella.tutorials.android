== Android Development

=== Android Operation System
		
Android is an operating system based on a modified

2.6
with a

programming interface. Also several drivers and libraries have been
modified to allow Android to run efficient on mobile devices.

It provides tools, e.g. a compiler, debugger
and a device
emulator as
well as its own Java Virtual machine
(Dalvik
Virtual Machine
- DVM).
Android
is
created by the
Open Handset Alliance
which is led
by
Google.
		
Android uses a special virtual machine, e.g. the Dalvik Virtual
Machine. Dalvik uses
special
bytecode. Therefore you cannot run
standard Java bytecode on
Android.
Android provides a tool "dx" which
allows to convert Java
Class
files
into "dex" (Dalvik Executable) files.
Android applications
are
packed into an .apk (Android Package) file by
the program "aapt" (Android Asset Packaging Tool). To
simplify
development Google provides the Android Developer Tools
(ADT) for
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Eclipse/article.html[ Eclipse]. The ADT performs automatically the conversion from class to dex
files and creates the apk during deployment.
