== Tutorial: SQLite, custom ContentProvider and Loader

=== Overview
		
The following demo is also available in the Android Market. To allow
more users to play with the app, it has been downported to Android
2.3.
If you have a barcode scanner installed on your Android phone,
you can
scan the following QR Code to go to the example app in the
Android
market. Please note that the app looks and behaves differently
due to
the different Android versions, e.g. you have an
`OptionMenu`
instead of the
_ActionBar_
and the theme is different.

We will create a "To-do" application which
allows
the user to enter
tasks
for himself. These items
will be
stored in the
SQLite
database and
accessed via a
`ContentProvider`.
		
The tasks are called "todo items" or "todos" in this tutorial.
		
The application consists
out of
two
_activities_
, one for
seeing a list of all todo items and
one for
creating and
changing a
specific todo item. Both
_activities_
will
communicate via
_Intents_.
		
To asynchronously load and manage the
`Cursor`
the main
_activity_
will use a
`Loader`.
		
The resulting application will look similar to the following.

=== Project
		
Create the project
`de.vogella.android.todos`
with the
_activity_
called
`TodosOverviewActivity`
. Create another
_activity_
called
`TodoDetailActivity`
.
		
=== Database classes
		
Create the
package
`de.vogella.android.todos.database`
.
This package
will store
the
classes for the database
handling.
		
As said earlier I consider having one separate class per table
as
best practice. Even though we have only one table in this example
we
will follow this practice. This way we are prepared in case our
database schema grows.
		
Create the following class. This class also contains constants
for the
table name and the columns.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/database/TodoTable.java[]
----		
		
Create the following
`TodoDatabaseHelper`
class. This class extends
`SQLiteOpenHelper`
and calls the static methods of the
`TodoTable`
helper class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/database/TodoDatabaseHelper.java[]
----		
		
We will use a
`ContentProvider`
for accessing the database; we will not write a data access object
(DAO) as we did in the previous SQlite example.
		
=== Create ContentProvider
		
Create the package
`de.vogella.android.todos.contentprovider`.
		
Create the following
`MyTodoContentProvider`
class which extends
`ContentProvider`.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/todo/MyTodoContentProvider.java[]
----

`MyTodoContentProvider`
implements
`update()`
,
`insert()`
,
`delete()`
and
`query()`
methods. These methods map more or less directly to the
`SQLiteDatabase`
interface.
		
It also has the
`checkColumns()`
method to validate that a query only requests valid columns.
		
Register your
`ContentProvider`
in your
AndroidManifest.xml file.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/todo/AndroidManifestCP.xml[]
----		

=== Resources

Our application requires several resources.
First define a menu
`listmenu.xml
`
in the folder
`res/menu`
. If you use the Android resource wizard to create the "listmenu.xml"
file, the folder will be created
for you; if you create the file
manually you also need to create the
folder manually.
		
This XML file will be used to define the option menu in our
application. The
`android:showAsAction="always"`
attribute will ensure that this menu entry is displayed in the
_ActionBar_
of our application.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/resources/listmenu.xml[]
----		
		
The user will be able to select the priority for the todo items. For
the priorities we create a string array. Create the
following file
`priority.xml`
in the
`res/values`
folder
.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/resources/priority.xml[]
----		
		
Define also additional strings for the
application.
Edit
`strings.xml`
under
`res/values`.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/resources/strings.xml[]
----	

=== Layouts
		
We will define three layouts. One will be used for the display of a
row
in the list, the other ones will be used by our
_activities_
.
		
The row layout refers to an icon called _reminder_.
Paste an icon of
type "png" called
"reminder.png"
into your
`res/drawable`
folders (
`drawable-hdpi`
,
`drawable-mdpi`
,
`drawable-ldpi`
)
		
If you do not have an icon
available you can copy the icon created
by the Android wizard
(ic_launcher.png in the res/drawable* folders)
or
rename the reference in the layout file. Please note that the
Android Developer Tools sometimes change the name of this generated
icon , so your file might not be called
"ic_launcher.png".
		
Alternatively you could
remove the
icon definition
from
the
"todo_row.xml" layout definition
file which you will create in
the
next
step.
		
Create the
"todo_row.xml" layout file
in the folder
<filename class="directory">res/layout_.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/layout/todo_row.xml[]
----
		
Create the
`todo_list.xml`
layout file. This layout
defines how
the list looks like.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/layout/todo_list.xml[]
----
		
Create the
`todo_edit.xml`
layout file. This layout will be used
to display and edit an
individual
todo item
in the
`TodoDetailActivity`
_activity_
.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/layout/todo_edit.xml[]
----
	
=== Activities
		
Change the coding of your activities to the following.
First
`TodosOverviewActivity.java`
.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/todo/TodosOverviewActivity.java[]
----		
		
And `TodoDetailActivity.java`
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/todo/TodoDetailActivity.java[]
----		

The resulting
`AndroidManifest.xml`
looks like the following.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/todo/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----

		
=== Start your application

Start your application. You should be able to enter a new
todo
item
via the "Insert" button in the ActionBar.
		
An existing todo item can be deleted on the list via a
long
press.

To change an existing todo item, touch the corresponding row. This
starts the second
_activity_.
