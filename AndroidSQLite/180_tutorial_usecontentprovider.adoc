== Tutorial: Using ContentProvider

=== Overview
		
The following example will use an existing
`ContentProvider`
from the
_People_
application.
		
=== Create contacts on your emulator
		
For this example we need a few maintained contacts. Select the
home
menu and then the
`People`
entry to
create contacts.

The app will ask you if you want to login. Either login or
select "Not now". Press ""Create a new contact". You can create local
contacts.

Finish adding your first contact. Afterwards the app allows you
to add more contacts via the + button. As a result you should have a
few new contacts in your application.
		
=== Using the Contact Content Provider
		
Create a new Android project called
_de.vogella.android.contentprovider_
with the
_activity_
called
_ContactsActivity_.
		
Change the corresponding
layout file in the
<filename class="directory">res/layout_
folder.
Rename
the ID of the existing
`TextView`
to
`contactview`. Delete the default text.
		
The resulting layout file
should look like the following.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/contentprovider/main.xml[]
----		
		
Access to the contact
`ContentProvider`
requires a certain
permission,
as not all applications should have
access to the contact
information.
Open the
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file,
and select the
`Permissions`
tab. On that
tab click the
btn:[Add] button,
and select the
`Uses Permission`.
From the drop-down list select
the
`android.permission.READ_CONTACTS`
entry.
		
Change the coding of the activity.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/contentprovider/ContactsActivity.java[]
----
		
If you run this application the data is read from the
`ContentProvider`
of the People application
and displayed in a
`TextView`. Typically you would display such data in a
`ListView`.
