== SimpleCursorAdapter
	
In case you work with a content provider or directly with the database you can use the `SimpleCursorAdapter` to define the data for your `ListView`. 
The following will demonstrate how to access the Contacts ContentProvider.
	
Create a new Android project called "de.vogella.android.listactivity.cursor" with the _activity_ called _MyListActivity_. 
Change `MyListActivity` to the following.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/cursor/MyListActivity.java[]
----
	
Make sure you give your application the permission to read the contacts (Uses Permissions "android.permission.READ_CONTACTS" in AndroidManifest.xml).
