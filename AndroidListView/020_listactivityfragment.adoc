[[listactivity]]
== ListActivity and ListFragment
[[listactivity_overview]]
=== Default container for using ListView
		
Android provides specialized fragment and activity classes to simplify list handling.
		
The classes are the `ListActivity` class, if you want to use lists in activities, and the `ListFragment` class, if you want to use lists in fragments.
		
You do not have to assign a layout to these elements. 
If you do not define a layout, the activity or fragment contains a single `ListView` by default.
`ListActivity` and `ListFragment` also allow you to override a `onListItemClick()` method for handling selection of list items.
		
Both classes allow you to set the adapter to the default `ListView` via the `setListAdapter()` method.
		
The following example code shows a simple `ListFragment` implementation.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/fragmentslist/MyListFragment.java[]
----
		
The next example code demonstrates the usage of a `ListActivity`.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/snippets/MyListActivity.java[]

[[listactivity_layout]]
=== ListActivity and custom layout
		
You can use a custom layout with `ListActivity` or `ListFragment`. 
In this case the fragment or activity searches in the provided layout for a `ListView` with the predefined `android:id` attribute set to `@android:id/list`. 
This usage is demonstrated by the following code snippet.
		

		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/lists/listid.xml[]
----
		
WARNING: If you do not use this ID or do not include a `ListView` into your layout, the application crashes once you try to display the activity or the fragment.
	
[[listactivity_emptyview]]
=== Placeholder for an empty list
		
You can also use a view with the `@android:id/empty` ID in your layout. 
The corresponding activity and fragment shows this view automatically if the `ListView` is empty and hides it otherwise.
For example, you could display an error message in such a view.
