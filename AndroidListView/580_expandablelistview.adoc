=== ExpandableListView
		
The `ExpandableListView` is similar to `ListView`, but allows you to define groups and details for this group.
`ExpandableListView` expects an adapter of type `BaseExpandableListAdapter`.
		
In this case you have to define two layouts, one for the group and another one for the details row.

Create a project called _com.vogella.android.listview.expandable_ with the activity called `MainActivity`.
		
Create or adjust the following layout files. 
First _layout/activity_main.xml_.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/expandablelistview/activity_main.xml[]
----
		
Afterwards create _layout/listrow_group.xml_.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/expandablelistview/listrow_group.xml[]
----
		
The last required layout is _layout/listrow_details.xml_.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/expandablelistview/listrow_details.xml[]
----
		
Create the following class which holds your domain model for the `ExpandableListView`.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/expandablelistview/Group.java[]

Finally create the adapter as described by the following listing and change the activity to the code provided below.
