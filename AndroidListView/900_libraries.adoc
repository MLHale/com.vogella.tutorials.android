== Additional Open Source libraries
	
Sometimes having to press a refresh button on the ActionBar to refresh data can be annoying for the user. 
Chris Banes has implemented an Open Source library to implement the pull to refresh pattern for a `Listview`. 
See https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh.
	
Also you may want to use the swipe to dismiss gesture to delete items from a ListView. 
Roman Nurik provides an example for this at https://github.com/romannurik/android-swipetodismiss[Android swipe-to-dismiss library] which Jake Wharton backported to earlier Android releases at https://github.com/JakeWharton/SwipeToDismissNOA[SwipeToDismissNOA].
