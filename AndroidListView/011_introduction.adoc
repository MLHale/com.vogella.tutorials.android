[[androidlists]]
== Android and the ListView widget
[[androidlists_view]]
=== Views for handling lists
		
Android provides the `ListView` and the `ExpandableListView` classes which are capable of displaying a scrollable list of items.
The `ExpandableListView` class supports a grouping of items.
		
[[androidlists_inputtype]]
=== Possible input types for lists
		
The input of a list (items in the list) can be arbitrary Java objects. 
The adapter extracts the correct data from the data object and assigns this data to the _views_ in the row of the `ListView`.
		
These items are typically called the _data model_ of the list.
An adapter can receive data as input.

[[androidlists_adapterintro]]
=== Adapters
		
An _adapter_ manages the data model and adapts it to the individual entries in the widget. 
An adapter extends the `BaseAdapter` class.
		
Every line in the widget displaying the data consists of a layout which can be as complex as you want. 
A typical line in a list has an image on the left side and two text lines in the middle as depicted in the following graphic.

A layout file for such a line might look like the following.

include::res/snippets/rowlayout_complex.xml[]

The adapter would inflate the layout for each row in its `getView()` method and assign the data to the individual views in the row.
		
The adapter is assigned to the `ListView` via the `setAdapter` method on the `ListView` object.
		
TIP: Adapters are not only used by `ListView`, but also by other views which extend `AdapterView` as, for example, `Spinner`, `GridView`, `Gallery` and `StackView`.
	
[[androidlists_filtersort]]
=== Filtering and sorting
		
The filtering and sorting of the data is handled by the adapter. 
You need to implement the logic in your custom adapter implementation.

[[adapterown_updates]]
=== Data updates in the adapter
		
The `notifyDataSetChanged()` method on the adapter is called if the data has changed or if new data is available.
		
The `notifyDataSetInvalidated()` method is called if the data is not available anymore.

[[listview_adapterlistener]]
=== Listener
		
To react to selections in the list, set an `OnItemClickListener` to your `ListView`.
