== Implementing undo for an action
[[listview_undoaction1]]
=== When should you offer an undo action?
		
It is good practice to allow the user to undo critical actions.
Such a critical action is, for example, the deletion of list items.
		
A proven pattern to handle this _undo option_ is to offer a selection at the end of the screen. 
This selection vanishes after a predefined time or once the user continues to interact with the application.
		
For example, the Gmail application implements such a behavior.

=== Example
		
The following description contains an example for implementing an _undo action_. 
It uses an animation to phase out the undo button automatically out after a while.
		
For this example create a new project called _com.vogella.android.userinterface.undo_ based on the _BlankTemplate_ template.
		
Create the following layout for your _activity_. 
It uses a `FrameLayout` to show two different parts of the user interface. 
The button bar is initially hidden. 
The button uses a drawable. 
Either add such a drawable to your project or remove the reference.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/undo/activity_main.xml[]
----
		
Change your _activity_ so that it is similar to the following code. 
The project wizard generated an `ActionBar` entry. 
This entry is used in the following code. 
If in doubt, create your own `ActionBar` entry.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/undo/MainActivity.java[]
----
		
If you select the entry in the _ActionBar_, the button bar becomes visible for 5 seconds.
