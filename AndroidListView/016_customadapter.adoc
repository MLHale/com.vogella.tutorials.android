[[adapterown_custom]]
=== Developing a custom adapter
		
The
`ArrayAdapter`
is limited as it supports only the mapping of
`toString()`
to one view in the row layout.
To control the data assignment and to
support
several views, you
have to
create your
custom adapter
implementation.
		
For this you would extend an
existing adapter
implementation or
subclass the
`BaseAdapter`
class directly.

TIP: Frequently you extend `ArrayAdapter` to write a custom adapter, as this is simpler than extending `BaseAdapter` directly.

=== Preparing a row for the list
		
The adapter needs to create a layout for each row of the list.
The
`ListView`
instance
calls the
`getView()`
method on the adapter for each data element. In this method the
adapter creates the row
layout and maps the data to the views in the
layout.
		
This root of the layout is typically a
`ViewGroup`
(layout manager)
and contains several other
views, e.g., an
`ImageView`
and a
`TextView`. The following graphic shows a list with different layouts for odd
and even rows.

Within the
`getView()`
method you would inflate an XML based layout and then set
the
content
of
the individual views based on the Java object for this row.
To
inflate the XML layout file, you can use the
`LayoutInflator`
system
service.
		
NOTE: This layout inflator service can get accessed via the `getLayoutInflator()` method of the activity or via the
`context.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE)` method call.
		
After the adapter inflated the layout, it searches for the relevant
views in the layout and fills them with the data.
The individual
elements
in the layout can be found via
the
`findViewById()`
method call on the top level view.

[[adapterown_example]]
=== Example for a custom adapter
		
The following code shows an implementation of a custom adapter. This
adapter
assumes that you have two png files (no.png and ok.png) in
one of
your
_directory]]res/drawable_
folders. The coding inflates an XML layout file,
finds the relevant
views
in the layout and sets their content based on the input data.

[[adapterown_interaction]]
=== Updating the data model from the adapter

The row can also contain
_views_
which interact with the underlying data model via the adapter. For
example, you can
have
a
`Checkbox`
in your row layout and if the
`Checkbox`
is selected, the underlying data is changed.
