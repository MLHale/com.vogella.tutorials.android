== Tutorial: How to display two items in a ListView

You can use the `SimpleAdapter` class to show the data of two elements. 
This class expects an Array of Strings (`from` data) in which the fields of the input data are defined. 
It also requires an Array of ints which defines the IDs of the widgets in the layout for the row to which these fields are mapped.

The actual data is then a list of Maps. 
The Map defines for each field in the `from` data a value.

The following shows an example which reuses a predefined layout from Android for the row.
