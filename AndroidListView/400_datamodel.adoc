=== Interaction between the model and Listview

Frequently you need to select items in your `ListView`. 
As the rows of the `ListView` are getting recycled you cannot store the selection on the `View` level.

Selection is just one possible example but you can imagine other interaction between your row and model.

To persist the selection you have to update your data model with the selected state.

To update the data model in your `ListView` you define your own `Adapter` class. 
In this adapter class you attach a listener to the `View` which is responsible for selecting the model element. 
If selected, you update the state in the model which you can add as a tag to the View to have access to it.

The following example demonstrates how to use standard Java objects and how to interact from the `Views` with the model.

=== Tutorial: Domain Model and list view rows interaction

Continue to use the `de.vogella.android.listactivity` project.

Create the following `Model` which holds the name and the information if this element is currently selected.

[source,java]
----
include::res/interactive/Model.java[]
----

Create the following new layout file called _rowbuttonlayout.xml_.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/interactive/rowbuttonlayout.xml[]
----

Create the following `Adapter`. 
This adapter adds a listener on the `Checkbox` view. 
If the checkbox is selected the underlying data of the model is changed.
`Checkbox` gets the corresponding model element assigned via the `getTag()` method.

[source,java]
----
include::res/interactive/InteractiveArrayAdapter.java[]
----

Finally change your activity to the following.

[source,java]
----
include::res/interactive/MyList.java[]
----

If you start your app you should be able to flag items. 
These changes will be reflected in your model.
