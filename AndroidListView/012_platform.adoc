== Default adapter

[[listview_defaultadapter]]
=== Default platform adapter
		
Android provides default
adapter implementations; the most important
are
`ArrayAdapter`
and
`CursorAdapter`.
`ArrayAdapter`
can handle data based on
`Arrays`
or
`java.util.List`.
`SimpleCursorAdapter`
can
handle database related data.

[[arrayAdapter]]
=== Using ArrayAdapter
		
The
`ArrayAdapter`
class can handle a list or array of Java objects as input. Every Java
object is mapped to one row. By
default,
it maps the
`toString()`
method of the object to a view in the row layout.
		
You can
define
the ID
of the view in the constructor of the
`ArrayAdapter`
otherwise the
`android.R.id.text1`
ID is used as default.
		
The
`ArrayAdapter`
class allows to remove all elements in its underlying data structure
with the
`clear()`
method call. You can then add new elements via the
`add()`
method or a `Collection` via the
`addAll()`
method.
		
You can also directly modify the underlying data structure and call
the
`notifyDataSetChanged()`
method on the
adapter
to notify it about the changes in data.
		
WARNING: If you want to change the data in your adapter, the underlying data structure must support this operation. 
This is, for example, the case for the `ArrayList` class, but not for arrays.

The following example shows the usage of the
`ListView`
view in an activity. It uses a default layout from the Android
platform for the row layout. It also demonstrates the removal of list
items and uses
animations for
the removal.
