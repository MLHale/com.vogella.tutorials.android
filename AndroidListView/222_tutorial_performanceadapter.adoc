== Performance Optimization

The following will implement a performance optimized version of the adapter from the previous example.
		
Create the following `MyPerformanceArrayAdapter` class.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/layoutinflator/MyPerformanceArrayAdapter.java[]
----

Use your new adapter in your _activity_. 
If you run the application it should look the same but it will be much faster, especially for large datasets.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/layoutinflator/MyListActivity.java[]
