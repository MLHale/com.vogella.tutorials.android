[[miscellaneous_longclick]]
=== Adding a longclick listener to the list items
		
You can also add a `LongItemClickListener` to the list view via the `setOnItemLongClickListener()` method.

[[miscellaneous_headerfooter]]
=== Header and footer
		
You can of course put arbitrary views elements around your list view.
For example you can define a layout with two text views and a list view between them.
In this case the two text views will always be visible above the list (header) and the other will be visible below the list. 
If you want to display a list header or list footer only at the beginning or end of the list you can use the `addHeaderView()` method or `addFooterView()` method on the `ListView` class.
