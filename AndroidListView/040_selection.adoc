[[listview_selection]]
== Storing the selection of a view
	
By default a `ListView` has no selection mode active. 
You can activate it via the `setChoiceMode()` method call. 
Pass `ListView.CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE` for multiple selections or `ListView.CHOICE_MODE_SINGLE` for single selections to this method.
	
To get the selected items of a `ListView`, use the `getCheckedItemPosition()` for a single selection method or `listView.getCheckedItemPositions()` for multiple selections. 
If you have stable ID, you could also use the `getCheckedItemIds()` method to get the selected IDs.
	
Android already provides a default layout for this: the `android.R.layout.simple_list_item_multiple_choice` layout which contains a configured `CheckedTextView` view.
	
The following activities demonstrate how to use these selection modes. 
If you use these modes, the `ListView` stores the selected values. 
It is not persisted in your data model.
