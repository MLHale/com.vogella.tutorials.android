== Tutorial: Implementing your customer adapter
		
The following uses two images "no.png" and "ok.png". 
I placed them in the "res/drawable-mdpi" folder. 
You must create your own icons. 
In case you do not find any icons just copy "icon.png" and use a drawing program to change it a little bit and create a second one.
		
Create the class `MySimpleArrayAdapter` which will serve as our adapter.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/simpleadapter/MySimpleArrayAdapter.java[]
----
		
To use this adapter, change the _activity_ to the following.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/simpleadapter/MyListActivity.java[]
----
		
If you run this example you should get a list with different icons for the certain elements.
		
image::listlayoutIndividual10.png[ListView with different elements for each row]
