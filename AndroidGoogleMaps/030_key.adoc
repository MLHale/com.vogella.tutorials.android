== Getting the Google Map key

=== Google console
		
To use Google Maps you need to create a valid Google Maps API key. 
The key is free, you can use it with any of your applications that call the Maps API.
This key supports an unlimited number of users.
		
You get this key via the https://code.google.com/apis/console[Google APIs Console].
You have to provide your application signature key and the application package name.
		
This is based on the key with which you sign your Android application during deployment. 
During development the Android build system, automatically creates and uses a _debug key_.
	
=== Creating the SHA-1 for your signature key
		
The debug key for signing your application can be found in the _userhome/.android/debug.keystore_ file.
		
To create the SHA-1 for your debug keystore you use the `keytool` command from your JDK installation.

Copy the SHA-1 output, as you need this later.
	
=== Register with the Google APIs Console
		
You have to register in the https://code.google.com/apis/console/[Google APIs Console] that you want to use Google Maps for Android. 
Select here the `Services` entry.

=== Create key for your application
		
You need later to register your application via its package in this console together with the SHA-1 fingerprint of your signature key.
For this you select the entry and click on the `API Access` entry. 
Afterwards click on the _Create new Android key..._ entry.

Enter your SHA-1 fingerprint and the package of your application separated by a semicolon. 
For example, in the following screenshot the `com.vogella.android.locationapi.maps` package is used.
