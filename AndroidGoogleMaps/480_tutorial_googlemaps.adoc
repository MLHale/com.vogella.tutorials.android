In this exercise you create an Android application which shows a `GoogleMap` via a fragment.
		
=== Install Google Play Services
		
Download and install the Google Play Service.

=== Get API key for Google Maps
		
Get your API key for Google maps, as described in
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidGoogleMaps/article.html#getting-the-google-map-key.
		
=== Create Project
		
Create a new Android project called
_com.vogella.android.locationapi.maps_
with an activity
called
`ShowMapActivity`.
		
=== Add permissions to the project
		
Change the manifest
file
to the following code by adding
permissions to your
application.

Get a valid API key for your application and enter this key in the
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file.

include::res/maps/activity_main.xml[]
----

=== Activity

Change your activity
to the following.
		
[source,java]

Run and test your application. You should be able to zoom in and
out
and send new geo coordinates to your
_activity_
via the Emulator.
