== Using Android platform themes

=== Using material design and design support library
		
As of API 21 the material design is the new default design you should be used.

* @android:style/Theme.Material (dark version)
* @android:style/Theme.Material.Light (light version)
* @android:style/Theme.Material.Light.DarkActionBar
		
The design support library provides themes with material design styles. 
This allows you to use material design on earlier releases. 
See https://developer.android.com/training/material/compatibility.html - Maintaining Compatibility for how to use the new theme in earlier releases.
		
=== Styling the color palette

As of material design you can customize the themes base colors.
The following screenshot shows several of these colors.

The following listing is an example of styling it with different
colors (defined in your /res/values folder).

include::res/material/styles.xml[]

You can also style the status bar with the `android:statusBarColor` attribute. 
By default, `android:statusBarColor` inherits the value of `android:colorPrimaryDark`.

=== Styling individual views and view groups
		
As of Android 5.0 (API 21) you can also assign the `android:theme` for a view. 
This allows changing the theme for this element and its child elements.
