=== Designing Android Applications

For designing great Android applications you should follow the following themes which are described in detail on the http://developer.android.com/design/index.html - Android design pages.

* Design for touch
* Show only what is needed
* Don't ask for permission for a certain action but allow the user to undo his action
* Only interrupt, if it is important
* Keep messages brief, use pictures
* Never lose your users data
* Allow users to make important things fast
* If is looks the same, it should act the same
* Help users make decisions, but let them have the final say

There a certain general design best practices, which are listed here:

* Design for performance - A well designed application should start fast. 
You should target for less than one second in average to start the application.
All potentially slow operations should be performed asynchronously.

* Design for responsiveness - Feedback to the user should be provided instantaneous. 
Long lasting operations should provide feedback to the user that they are running.

* Design for instant data - 
Your application should provide, if possible, recent data once the user starts it. 
You should therefore use _services_ to fetch data from external servers to be decoupled from the user interface.

* Design for optimized battery life - 
Your application should consume as little energy as possible.
Stop user interface updates and listeners if your application is currently not visible.
You can listen to relevant events, e.g. if power supply is plugged in to perform larger updates.
If you fetch data from an external server you should, if appropriate, use the Google push notification service. 
This allows you to access the network only if data is available.

* Design for efficient network access  - Your application should avoid unnecessary network access, via push notifications. 
You should also consider the current available network. 
If you are connected to a wireless lane, your application
can download more data.



The http://developer.android.com/design/index.html - Android design pages explain the design principles of Android applications.

Creating promotional material

The http://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/promote/device-art.html - Device Art Generator website   allows you to create promotional material of your
application with a
nice device frame around it. 
Simply make a screenshot on your device and drag it onto the correct device to get a nice image for it.

=== Responsive design

It is recommended that the application scales with the device.
On a small screen only one fragment is shown, on a larger screen a
second or even third fragment might be visible.

This approach is depicted by the following graphic.

It is recommended not to use the full screen width for text in case you are beyond a certain width on a device.
This border is typically above `w1000dp`.
Research has shown that after this width reader much move the head to much 

A way to implement margin points is to use a _res/values/dimens.xml_ file and define a dimension for the margins. 
Afterwards use resource qualifiers for the same file to define different margins for larger devices.
