== Android Touch

=== Android touch basics
		
The Android
standard
`View`
class
support touch events. You can react to touch events in your
custom views and your
activities. Android supports multiple pointers,
e.g. fingers which are interacting with the screen.

The base class for touch support is the
`MotionEvent`
class which is passed to
`Views`
via the
`onTouchEvent()`
method.

To react to
touch
events

you override the
`onTouchEvent()`
method.
		
The
`MotionEvent`
class
contains the touch related information, e.g., the number of
pointers, the X/Y coordinates and size and pressure of each pointer.

This method returns
`true`
if the touch event has been handled by the view. Android tries to
find the deepest view which returns true to handles the touch event.
If the view is part of another view (parent view), the parent can
claim the event by returning
`true`
from the
`onInterceptTouchEvent()`
method. This would send an
`MotionEvent.ACTION_CANCEL`
event to the view which received previously the touch events.
		
To react to touch events in an
activity,
register an
`OnTouchListener`
for the relevant
`Views`.
	
=== Single touch
		
If single
input is used you can
use the `getX()`
and
`getY()`
methods to get the current position of the first finger.
		
Via the
`getAction()`
method
you receive the action which was performed. The
`MotionEvent`
class provides the following constants to determine the action which
was performed.

.Touch Events
|===
|Event |Description

|MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN
|New touch started

|MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE
|Finger is moving

|MotionEvent.ACTION_UP
|Finger went up

|MotionEvent.ACTION_CANCEL
|Current event has been canceled, something else took control of the touch event

|MotionEvent.ACTION_POINTER_DOWN
|Pointer down (multi-touch)

|MotionEvent.ACTION_POINTER_UP
|Pointer up (multi-touch)
|===

=== Multi touch
		
Multi-touch is available since
Android 2.0 and has been improved
in the version 2.2. This description uses the API as of version 2.2.
		
The
`MotionEvent.ACTION_POINTER_DOWN`
and
`MotionEvent.ACTION_POINTER_UP`
are send starting with the second finger. For the first finger
`MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN`
and
`MotionEvent.ACTION_UP`
are used.
		
The
`getPointerCount()`
method on
`MotionEvent`
allows you to determine the number of pointers on the device. All
events and the position of the pointers are included in the instance
of
`MotionEvent`
which you receive in the
`onTouch()`
method.
		
To track the
touch events from multiple pointers you have to use the
`MotionEvent.getActionIndex()`
and the
`MotionEvent.getActionMasked()`
methods to identify the index of the pointer and the touch event
which
happened for this pointer.
		
This pointer
index can
change over time, e.g. if one finger is lifted
from the device. The stable version of a
pointer is the
_pointer id_
,
which can be determined with the
`getPointerId(pointerIndex)`
method from the
`MotionEvent`
object.
		
The usage if demonstrated in the following code snippet.

TIP: Multitouch can not be tested on the emulator. You need a real Android device as input device.

=== GestureDetectors
		
Android provide the
`GestureDetector`
class which allow to
consume
`MotionEvents`
and to create
higher level gesture
events to listeners.
		
For example the
`ScaleGestureDetector`
class allows to determine the
predefined gesture of increasing and
decreasing the size of the object via two fingers.
