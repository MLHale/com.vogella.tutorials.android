== Tutorial: ScaleGestureDetector
	
Create the Android project called
_de.vogella.android.touch.scaledetector_
with an Activity called
_ScaleDetectorTestActivity_.
	
Create the following class.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/scale/ImageViewWithZoom.java[]
----	
	
Add this
`View`
to your
_activity_.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/scale/ScaleDetectorTest.java[]
----
	
If you run your application you should be able to shrink and
enlarge the image via a multi-touch gesture (pitch zoom).
