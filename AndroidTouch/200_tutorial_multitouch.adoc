== Exercise: Multitouch
	
In this exercise you create a view which support multitouch and
allows
you to track several fingers on your device. On the Android
emulator
you can only simulate singletouch with the mouse.
	
Create an Android project called _com.vogella.android.multitouch_
with an activity
called
_MainActivity_.
	
Create the following
`MultitouchView`
class.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/multi/MultitouchView.java[]
----	
	
Add this view to the layout of your activity.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/multi/activity_main.xml[]
----
	
Your generated activity can remain the same.

[source,java]
----
include::res/multi/MainActivity.java[]
----
	
If you run your application you will be able to draw on the
screen with your fingers. Every device has an upper limit how many
pointers are supported, test out how many simultaneous pointers your
device supports. This application should look similar to the following
