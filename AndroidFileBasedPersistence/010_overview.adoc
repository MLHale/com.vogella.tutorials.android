== File based persistence

=== Methods of local data persistence

Android allows to persists application data via the file system.
For each application the Android system creates a _data/data/[application package]_
directory.

Android supports the following ways of storing data in the local file system:

* Files - You can create and update files
* Preferences - Android allows you to save and retrieve persistent key-value pairs of primitive data type.
* SQLite database - instances of SQLite databases are also stored on the local file system.

Files are saved in the _files_ folder and application settings are saved as XML files in the _shared_prefs_ folder.

If your application creates an SQLite database this database is saved in the main application directory under the _databases_ folder.

The following screenshot shows a file system which contains file, cache files and preferences.

Only the application can write into its application directory.
It can create additional sub-directories in this application directory.
For these sub-directories, the application can grant read or write permissions for other applications.



=== Internal vs. external storage

Android has internal storage and external storage.
External storage is not private and may not always be availale. 
If, for example, the Android device is connected with a computer, the computer may mount the external system via USB and that makes this external storage not avaiable for Android applications.

=== Application on external storage

As of Android 8 SDK level it is possible to define that the application can or should be placed on external storage. 
For this set the `android:installLocation` to preferExternal or auto.

In this case certain application components may be stored on an encrypted external mount point.
Database and other private data will still be stored in the internal storage system.
