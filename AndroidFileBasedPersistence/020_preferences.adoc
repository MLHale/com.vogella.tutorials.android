== Preferences

=== Storing key-value pairs
		
Android supports the usage of the
_SharedPreferences_
class
for persisting key-value pairs (preferences)of primitive data
types in the Android file system.
		
The
definition of these preferences can
be done
via an XML
resource.
		
The
`PreferenceManager`
class provides methods to get access to preferences stored in a
certain file.
The following code
shows how to
access
preferences from a
certain file
		
[source,txt]
----
include::res/preferences/getPrefs.txt[]
----		

Preferences should be created private for the application. They can be accessed
via all application components.
Sharing data with other application
with world readable or writable
preference file is rarely used, as
the external
component would need to know the exact filename and
location of the file.
		
The default preferences are available from any component via the
`PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this)`
method call.
Preference value are accessed via the key and the instance of the
`SharedPreferences`
class, as demonstrated in the following listing.
		
[source,txt]
----
include::res/preferences/getPrefsValue.txt[]
----		

To create or change preferences you have to call the
`edit()`
method on
the
`SharedPreferences`
object. Once you have changed the value you have to call the
`apply()`
method
to
apply your asynchronously to the file system. The usage of
the
`commit()`
method is discouraged, as it write the changes synchronously to the
file system.
		
[source,txt]
----
include::res/preferences/updatePrefs.txt[]
----
	
=== Preference Listener
		
You can listen to changes in the preferences via the
`registerOnSharedPreferenceChangeListener()`
method on
`SharedPreferences`.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/listener/preference.java[]
----		
		
One watch out is that
`SharedPreferences`
keeps listeners in a
`WeakHashMap`
hence listener may be recycled if your code does not hold a reference
to it.
