== Exercise: Starting activities

=== Target of this exercise
		
The following exercise demonstrates how to use an explicit intent to start a sub-activity and how to send data to it.
	
=== Create project and main layout
		
Create a new Android project called _com.vogella.android.intent.explicit_ with an activity called `MainActivity`.
		
Change the layout file of this activity to the following.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/explicit/activity_main.xml[]
----

=== Create new layout file
		
Create a new layout called _activity_result.xml_. 
In the next step you create a new activity which will use this layout file.
		
Enter _activity_result.xml_ as file name and press the btn:[Finish] button. 
Change your layout so that it is similar to the following XML file.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/explicit/activity_result.xml[]
----
		
=== Create additional activity
		
Create a new class called `ResultActivity` based on the following example code.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/explicit/ResultActivity0.java[]
----
		
Add a new activity called _ResultActivity_ to the _AndroidManifest.xml_ file.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/explicit/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----
		
NOTE: This new activity will be started via the `MainActivity` , hence it is called a sub-activity.

=== Start sub-activity
		
Start the sub-activity via a button click from the `MainActivity` class. 
The following code gives some pointers on how to solve this. 
Solve the TODO's in the source code so that the `ResultActivity` activity is started from the `onClick()` method.
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/explicit/MainActivity1.java[]
----	
		
Once you finished this part of the exercise, start your application and ensure that you can start the second activity.

=== Send data to ResultActivity
		
The `MainActivity` class should pass the value of the `EditText` view to the sub-activity. 
For this use the `putExtra("yourKey", string)` on the `Intent` object.
		
=== Get intent data in the ResultActivity
		
In your `ResultActivity` sub-activity get the `Bundle` with the intent data via the `getIntent().getExtras()` method call.
		
Get the value of the passed extra with the `extras.getString("yourkey")` method on the bundle object which you got with the `getExtras()` call.
		
This value should be placed in the `TextView` with the `displayintentextra` ID.
		
=== Exercise: Return data from ResultActivity
		
In the following exercise you transfer data back from your second sub-activity to the `MainActivity` once the user selects the btn:[Back] button.

Add the implementation of the `finish()` method to the `ResultActivity` class.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/explicit/ResultActivity2.java[]
----
		
Solve all TODOs.
	
=== Evaluate the return data in MainActivity
		
Use the `startActivityForResult()` method in `MainActivity` to start the sub-activity. 
This allows you to use the `onActivityResult()` method to receive data from the sub-activity.
Extract the extra data with the received bundle.
		
Show a `Toast` with the extra data to validate that you correctly received it. 
The following code contains some pointer on how to solve that.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/explicit/MainActivity2.java[]
----
		
=== Solution: Using intents
		
After finishing this exercise your activity coding should look similar to the following classes.
		
You can use this chapter to compare your solution with the proposed solution.
