== Introduction to the toolbar
=== What is the toolbar (action bar)?
(((Action Bar,Toolbar)))
(((Toolbar)))
The _toolbar bar_ (formerly known as action bar) is represented as of Android 5.0 via the `Toolbar` view group.
It can be freely positioined into your layout file.
It can display the activity title, icon, actions which can be triggered, additional views and other interactive items. 
It can also be used for navigation in your application.
		
Before Android 5.0 the location of the toolbar (actionbar) was hard coded to the top of the activity.
It is possible to disable the toolbar via the used theme, but the default Android themes have it enabled.
	

The following screenshot shows the toolbar of the Google+ Android application with interactive items and a navigation bar. 
On top it also indicates that the user can open a navigation bar on the side of the application.

=== Action bar on devices lower than API 21
		
The toolbar has been introduced in Android 5.0 (API 21). 
If you want to use the toolbar on devices with an earlier Android release you can use the downport provided by the `appcompat-v7` support library. 
To use the toolbar on such devices add a compile dependency to `com.android.support:appcompat` to your Gradle build file.
For example:

[source,gradle]
----
compile `com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22.2.0`
----

See the following link for setting up the library v7 in your project: http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html.
		

=== Once upon a time their was the options menu

Applications with a target SDK version less than API 11 use the _options menu_, if such a button is present on the device. 
The option menu is displayed if the user presses the btn:[Option] button. 
The toolbar bar is superior to the options menu, as the action bar is clearly visible, while the options menu is only shown on request.
In case of the options menu, the user may not recognize that options are available in the application.
