== Navigation via the application icon
=== Application icon as home
		
The action bar shows an icon of your application. 
This is called the _home icon_. 
You can assign an action to this icon. 
The recommendation is to return to the main activity in your program if the user selects this icon.
		
If the action is selected, the `onOptionsItemSelected()` method is called with an action which has the `android.R.id.home` ID.
		
Before Android 4.1, you had to use the `android.R.id.home` ID in the `onOptionMenuItemSelected()` method and enable the selection of the home button. 
This is demonstrated by the following code in which the `SecondActivity` activity defines the `MainActivity` as home.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/navigation/home.java[]
----		

[TIP] 
====
As of Android 4.1 you can simply set the `parentActivityName` in the _AndroidManifest.xml_ file pointing to the parent _activity_.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/navigation/home.xml[]

=== Application icon as Up button
		
You can use the application icon also as  btn:[Up] button, e.g., to go to the parent activity of the current activity. 
The back button on the device always returns to the previous activity.
		
Both can be different, for example, if the user started the option to write an email from the home screen, the back button will return the user to the home screen while the btn:[Up] button would return the user to the activity which shows an overview of all emails.
		
To enable the _Up_ display, you can use the following code snippet in your activity.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/homeupnavigation/Up.java[]
----
		
NOTE: This snippet only enables the _Up_ display on your home icon. 
You need to implement the correct behavior in your activity in the `onOptionsItemSelected()` method. 
The corresponding action still has the `android.R.id.home` ID.

WARNING: The difference between btn:[Up] and the btn:[Back] button can be confusing for the end user. 
If you decide to implement _Up_, in your application, it is recommended to perform some end user testing to see if the _Up_ implementation is intuitive for them or not.
