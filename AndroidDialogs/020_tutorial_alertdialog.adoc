The following demonstrates the usage of the `DialogFragment` dialog in an activity with an existing dialog and with a custom layout for the dialog.
		
=== Create project and layout files

Create a new Android project with the `com.android.vogella.com.dialogfragmentexample` package.
		
Ensure that the layout file of your activity contains two buttons pointing both to `onClick` method in their `android:onClick` property.
		
Create the following layout file, called `fragment_username.xml`.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/dialog/fragment_username.xml[]

[source,java]
----
include::res/dialog/MyAlertDialogFragment.java[]
----
		
[source,java]

include::res/dialog/MyDialogFragment.java[]
----
