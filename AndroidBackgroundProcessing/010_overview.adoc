== Background processing in Android

=== Why using concurrency?
		
By default, application code  runs in the main thread. 
Every statement is therefore executed in sequence.
If you perform a long lasting operation, the application blocks until the corresponding operation has finished.
		
To provide a good user experience all potentially slow running operations in an Android application should run asynchronously.
This can be archived via concurrency constructs of the Java language or of the Android framework. 
Potentially slow operations are for example network, file and database access and complex calculations.
		
NOTE: Android enforces a worst case reaction time of applications.
If an _activity_ does not react within 5 seconds to user input, the Android system displays an _Application not responding_ (ANR) dialog. 
From this dialog the user can choose to stop the application.


=== Main thread
		
Android modifies the user interface and handles input events from one single thread, called the  _main thread_. 
Android collects all events in this thread in a queue and processes this queue with an instance of the `Looper` class.

=== Threading in Android

Android supports the usage of the `Thread`  class to perform asynchronous processing.
Android also supplies the `java.util.concurrent` package to perform something in the background.
For example, by using the `ThreadPools` and `Executor` classes.
		
If you need to update the user interface from a new `Thread`, you need to synchronize with the main thread.		
Because of this restrictions, Android developer typically use Android specific code constructs. 
	
Android provides additional constructs to handle concurrently in comparison with standard Java.

You can use the `android.os.Handler` class or the `AsyncTasks` classes. 
More sophisticated approaches are based on the `Loader` class, retained fragments and services.
	
=== Providing feedback to a long running operation
	
If you are performing a long running operation it is good practice to provide feedback to the user about the running operation.
	
You can provide progress feedback via the _action bar_ for example via an _action view_. 
Alternatively you can use a `ProgressBar` in your layout which you set to visible and update it during a long running operation. 
Non blocking feedback is preferred so that the user can continue to interact with the applicatoin.
	
[TIP]
==== 
Avoid using the blocking `ProgressBar` dialog or similar approaches if possible. 
Prefer providing inline feedback to that your user interface stays responsive.
