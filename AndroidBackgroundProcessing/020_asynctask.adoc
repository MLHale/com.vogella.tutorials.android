== AsyncTask
=== Purpose of the AsyncTask class
		
The `AsyncTask` class allows to run instructions in the background and to synchronize again with the main thread. 
It also reporting progress of the running tasks.
AsyncTasks should be used for short background operations which need to update the user interface. .
		
=== Using the AsyncTask class
		
To use `AsyncTask` you must subclass it. 
AsyncTask uses generics and varargs. 
The parameters are the following `AsyncTask <TypeOfVarArgParams, ProgressValue, ResultValue>`.

An `AsyncTask` is started via the `execute()` method.	
This `execute()` method calls the `doInBackground()` and the `onPostExecute()` method.
		
TypeOfVarArgParams is passed into the `doInBackground()` method as input.
ProgressValue is used for progress information and ResultValue must be returned from `doInBackground()` method.
This parameter is passed to `onPostExecute()` as a parameter.
		
The `doInBackground()` method contains the coding instruction which should be performed in a background thread. 
This method runs automatically in a separate `Thread`.
		
The `onPostExecute()` method synchronizes itself again with the user interface thread and allows it to be updated. 
This method is called by the framework once the `doInBackground()` method finishes.
		
=== Parallel execution of several AsyncTasks
		
Android executes `AsyncTask` tasks before Android 1.6 and again as of Android 3.0 in sequence by default.
You can tell Android to run it in parallel with the usage of the `executeOnExecutor()` method specifying `AsyncTask.THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR` as first parameter.
		
The following code snippet demonstrates that.

[NOTE]
====
The `AsyncTask` does not handle configuration changes automatically, i.e. if the _activity_ is recreated.
The programmer has to handle that in his coding.
A common solution to this is to declare the `AsyncTask` in a retained headless fragment.

=== Example: AsyncTask
		
The following code demonstrates how to use the `AsyncTask` class to download the content of a webpage.
		
Create a new Android project called _de.vogella.android.asynctask_ with an _activity_ called _ReadWebpageAsyncTask_.
Add the `android.permission.INTERNET` permission to your _AndroidManifest.xml_ file.
		
Create the following layout.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/asynctask/main.xml[]
----
		
Change your activity to the following: 

[source,java]
----
include::res/asynctask/ReadWebpageAsyncTask.java[]
----		
		
Run your application and press the button.
The defined webpage is read in the background. 
Once this process is done your `TextView` is updated.
