== Activity instance state

_Instance state_
of an activity
which is required to restore the activity to the state
in which the
user left
it. This is non-persistent application data that
needs to be
passed between activities restarts during a configuration
change to
restore user selections.
The application is responsible for
restoring its instance state.

Assume for example the user scrolled through a
`ListView`
with thousands of items and the activity is recreated. Loosing the
position in the list is annoying for the user, hence the position
should be restored.

The
`onSaveInstanceState()`
can be used to store this instance state as a
`Bundle`. A
`Bundle`
can contain primitive data types, arrays, String and
objects which are
of the
`Parcelable`
or
`Serialisable`
type.

The persisted
`Bundle`
data
is passed at restart of the activity
to the
`onCreate()`
method and
`onRestoreInstanceState()`
as parameter.

If you override
`onSaveInstanceState()`
and
`onRestoreInstanceState()`
you should call the super
implementation of
it, because the default
views of Android
store their
data
via a call to
`View.onSaveInstanceState`
from the
`onSaveInstanceState()`
method of the activity.
For
example
`EditText`
stores its content via the default call of this method.

The
`onRestoreInstanceState()`
or the
`onCreate()`
methods
can be used to recreate the instance scope of an activity if it
is
restarted.

TIP: Prefer using the `onRestoreInstanceState()` method for restoring the instance state. 
This approach separates the initial setup from restoring the state.

If the user interacts with an activity and presses the
_Back_
button or if the
`finish()`
method of an activity is called, the activity is removed from the
current activity stack and recycled. In this case there is no instance
state to save and the
`onSaveInstanceState()`
method is not called.

If the user interacts with an activity and presses the
_Home_
button, the activity instance state must be saved. The
`onSaveInstanceState()`
method is called. If the user
restarts the application it will resume
or restart the
last running activity. If it restarts the activity it
provides the bundle with the save data
to the
`onRestoreInstanceState()`
and
`onCreate()`
methods.

WARNING: The
`onSaveInstanceState()`
method
is
not called if the user
presses the
back
button. Don't use this
approach to save
the
data which needs to get
persisted.
