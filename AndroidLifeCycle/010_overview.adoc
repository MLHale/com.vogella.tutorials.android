== Managing the application life cycle

=== The out-of-memory killer

In an ideal case all Android applications started by the user remain in memory.
That makes applications switching much faster for the user.
But in reality the available memory on an Android device is limited. 
To manage these limited resources the Android system can terminate running processes.
	
If the Android system needs to free up resources it follows a simple set of rules. 
Every process gets a priority in the following order.
	
If the Android system needs to terminate processes it follows the following priority system.

.Priorities
[cols="1,3,1",options="header"]
|===
|Process status |Description |Priority
	
|Foreground
|An application in which the user is interacting with an activity, or which has an service which is bound to such an activity. 
Also if a service is executing one of its lifecycle methods or a broadcast receiver which runs its `onReceive()` method.
|1

|Visible
|User is not interacting with the activity, but the activity is still (partially) visible or the application has a service which is used by a inactive but visible activity.
|2

|Service
|Application with a running service which does not qualify for 1 or 2.
|3

|Background
|Application with only stopped activities and without a service or executing receiver. 
Android keeps them in a least recent used (LRU) list and if requires terminates the one which was least used.
|4

|Empty
|Application without any active components.
|5
|===
	
All processes in the empty list are added to a _least recently used_ list (LRU list).
The processes which are at the beginning of this lists will be the ones killed by the out-of-memory killer. 
If an application is restarted by the user, its gets moved to the end of this queue.
If it reaches the lowest prio again, as indicated by the following graphic.

=== Application
	
The application object is created before any of your Android components are started. 
If you do not specify one in your _AndroidManifest.xml_ file, the Android system creates a default object for you.
It is started in a new process with a unique ID under a unique user. 
This object provides the following main life-cycle methods:

* `onCreate()` - called before the first components of the application starts
* `onLowMemory()` - called when the Android system requests that the application cleans up memory
* `onTrimMemory()` - called when the Android system requests that the application cleans up memory. 
This message includes an indicator in which position the application is. 
For example the constant TRIM_MEMORY_MODERATE indicates that the process is around the middle of the background LRU list; freeing memory can help the system keep other processes running later in the list for better overall performance.
* `onTerminate()` - only for testing, not called in production
* `onConfigurationChanged()` - called whenever the configuration changes

The application object starts before any component and runs at least as long as another component of the application runs.
