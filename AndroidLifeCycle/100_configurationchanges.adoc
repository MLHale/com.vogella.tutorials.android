== Controlling configuration

=== Avoiding configuration change restarts
		
An
activity
is restarted if a
_configuration change_
occurs.
A
configuration change happens if an event is triggered from
the
actual the Android device which may be
relevant for the
application.
		
An instance of the
`Configuration`
class defines the current configuration of the device. Typical
configuration is the device orientation, the locale the smallest
width, etc.
		
For example
if the user
changes
the
orientation of the device
(vertically
or
horizontally). Android
assumes
that an activity
might want
to use different resources for these orientations and
restarts the
activity.
		
In case an activity is restarted the programmer must ensure that
the activity is recreated in the same state as before the restart.
The
Android provides several potential means for doing this.
		
In the emulator you can
simulate the
change of the
orientation via the
kbd:[Ctrk+F11]
shortcut.
		
You can avoid a restart of your application for certain
configuration
changes via the
`configChanges`
attribute on your
_activity_
definition in
your
`AndroidManifest.xml`. The following setting avoids an
_activity_
restart incase of orientation
changes or
position of the
physical
keyboard (hidden / visible).

TIP: Avoid using the configChanges attribute if possible. 
It is typically better to use other means to handle configuration changes, like the Android loader framework or headless retained fragments. 
These concept are covered later.

=== Fixing the orientation for an activity
		
It is also possible to define that an activity should only be used in
a specific screen orientation via the
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file. Such an example configuration is listed below.
