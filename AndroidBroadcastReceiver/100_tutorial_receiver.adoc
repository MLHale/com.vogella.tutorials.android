== Exercise: Register a receiver for incoming phone calls

=== Target
		
In this exercise you define a broadcast receiver which listens
to telephone
state
changes. If the phone receives a phone call, then
our
receiver
will be
notified and log a message.
		
=== Create project
		
Create a new project called
`de.vogella.android.receiver.phone`. Also create an activity.
		
TIP:Remember that your receiver is only called if the user started
it once. This requires an activity.

=== Implement receiver for the phone event
		
Create the
`MyPhoneReceiver`
class.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/receiver/MyPhoneReceiver.java[]
----		
	
=== Request permission
		
Add the
`android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE`
permission to your manifest file which allows you to listen to state
changes in your receiver. Also Register your receiver in your
manifest
file. The resulting manifest should be similar to the
following listing.
		
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/receiver/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----
		
=== Validate implementations
		
Install your application and simulate a phone call via the
Android Device Monitor. Validate that your receiver is
called and logs
a message
to
the
`LogCat`
view.
