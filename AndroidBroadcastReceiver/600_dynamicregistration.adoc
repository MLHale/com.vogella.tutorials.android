== Dynamic broadcast receiver registration

=== Dynamically registered receiver
		
Receiver can be registered via the Android manifest file.
You can also
register and unregister
a receiver at runtime
via the
`Context.registerReceiver()`
and
`Context.unregisterReceiver()`
methods.
		
WARNING: Do not forget to unregister a dynamically registered _receiver_ by using `Context.unregisterReceiver()` method.
If you forget this, the Android system reports a `leaked broadcast receiver` error.
For instance, if you registered a receive in `onResume()` methods of your activity, you should unregister it in the `onPause()` method.

=== Using the package manager to disable static receivers
		
You can use the
`PackageManager`
class to enable or disable receivers registered in your
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/packagemanager/register.java[]

=== Sticky (broadcast) intents
		
An intent to trigger a receiver (
_broadcast intent_
)
is not available anymore after it was sent
and processed by the
system.
If you use the
`sendStickyBroadcast(Intent)`
method, the corresponding
_intent_
is sticky, meaning the intent
you are sending stays around after the
broadcast is complete.
		
The Android system uses sticky broadcast for certain system
information. For example, the battery status is send as sticky
intent
and
can get received at any time. The following example demonstrates
that.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/sticky/check.java[]
----		
		
You can
retrieve that data
through the return value of
`registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver,
	IntentFilter)
`. This also works for a null
`BroadcastReceiver`.
		
In all other ways,
this behaves just as
`sendBroadcast(Intent)`.
		
Sticky broadcast intents
typically require special permissions.
