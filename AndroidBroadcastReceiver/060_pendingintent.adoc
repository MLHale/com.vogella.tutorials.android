== Pending Intent
	
A
_pending intent_
is
a token that you give to another
application
(e.g., notification
manager, alarm manager or other 3rd
party
applications), which allows
this
other application to use the
permissions of your application to
execute
a
predefined piece of code.
	
To perform a broadcast
via a
pending intent, get a
`PendingIntent`
via
the
`getBroadcast()`
method of the
`PendingIntent`
class.
To perform an activity via a
pending intent, you receive the
activity via
`PendingIntent.getActivity()`.
