== Broadcast receiver

=== Definition

A _broadcast receiver_ (_receiver_) is an Android component which allows you to register for system or application events. 
All registered receivers for an event are notified by the Android runtime once this event happens.

For example, applications can register for the
`ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED`
system event
which is fired once the Android system has
completed
the
boot process.

=== Implementation

A
receiver
can be registered via the
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file.

Alternatively to this static registration, you can also register
a
receiver
dynamically via the
`Context.registerReceiver()`
method.

The implementing class for a receiver
extends the
`BroadcastReceiver`
class.

If the event for which the
broadcast receiver
has registered happens,
the
`onReceive()`
method of the receiver
is called by the Android system.

=== Life cycle of a broadcast receiver

After the
`onReceive()`
of the receiver class
has finished,
the Android system is allowed to
recycle the receiver.

=== Asynchronous processing

Before API level 11, you could not
perform any asynchronous operation
in the
`onReceive()`
method, because once the
`onReceive()`
method had been finished,
the Android system was allowed to recycle that
component. If you have potentially long
running operations, you should
trigger a service instead.


Since Android API 11 you can call the
`goAsync()`
method. This method returns an object of the
`PendingResult`
type.
The Android system considers the
receiver as alive
until you call
the
`PendingResult.finish()`
on this object. With this option you can trigger asynchronous
processing in a receiver. As soon as that thread has
completed, its
task calls
`finish()`
to indicate to the Android system that this component can be
recycled.

=== Restrictions for defining broadcast receiver

As of Android 3.1 the Android system excludes all
receiver
from receiving intents by default
if the corresponding
application has
never been started by the user
or if the user explicitly stopped the
application via the Android
menu
(in
menu:Manage[Application]
).

This is an additional security feature as the user can be sure that
only the applications he started will receive
broadcast
_intents_.

TIP: This does not mean the user has to start the application again
after a reboot. The Android system remembers that
the user already
started it. Only one start is required without a forced stop by
the user.

=== Send the broadcast to your application for testing

You can use the following command from the adb command line tool. The class name and
package names which are
targeted via the command line tool need to be as defined in the manifest. You should send the intent
you generated to
your specific component, for example if you send a general ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast, this
will trigger a lot of
things in an Android system.

=== Pending Intent
	
A _pending intent_ is a token that you give to another application.
For example, the notification manager, alarm manager or other 3rd party applications).
This allows the  other application to restore the permissions of your application to execute a predefined piece of code.
	
To perform a broadcast via a pending intent, get a `PendingIntent` via  the `getBroadcast()` method of the `PendingIntent` class.
To perform an activity via a pending intent, you receive the activity via `PendingIntent.getActivity()`.
