== Android Studio overview and installation

=== Android Developer Tools and Android Studio

Google provides an IDE called _Android Studio_ to develop Android applications. 

Android applications require several Android specific configuration files.
The application logic is primarily written in the Java programming language.
		
The Android development tooling converts these files into an Android application.
The tooling allows to compile, package, deploy and start application which are developed.
The _Android Software Development Kit_ (Android SDK) and the Gradle tooling contains the necessary tools for this.

The Android SDK contains the _Android debug bridge_ (adb). 
adb is a tool that allows you to connect to a virtual or real Android device.
This allows managing the device or debugging your application.

		
Most of Android's configuration files are based on XML. 
The Android tools provide specialized editors for Android specific files.
These editors typically allow you to switch between the XML representation of the file and a structured user interface.


=== System requirements

Development for Android can be done on a reasonably sized computer. 
For a nice experience a modern computer is recommended, for example, a 2.6 GHz CPU with at least 8 GB of memory. 
An SSD speeds up the  start of the Android emulator significantly.
		
		
The Android SDK is 32-bit, therefore on a *64-bit Linux* system you need to have the package `ia32-libs` installed. 
For Ubuntu you can do this via the following command.

[source,console]
----
apt-get install ia32-libs
----
		
Please check your distribution documentation if you are using a different flavor of Linux.

=== Download and installation of Android Studio
		
Download Android Studio from the following URL: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

The download comes in two flavors, SDK Tools only and Android Studio Packages. 
You want to download the Android Studio Package for your operation system.

Installation for Windows is simple, just launch the .exe you downloaded. 
On Max OSX drag and drop Android Studio into the Applications folder.
		
On Linux unpack the downloaded ZIP file into an appropriate location for your applications. 
To launch Android Studio, navigate to the android-studio/bin/ directory in a terminal and execute studio.sh.
		
The first time you start a new Android Studio installation, you have the option to import your existing settings.

=== Managing the Android API level to develop against

The Android SDK manager allows you to install and delete specific Android OS versions.
		
Select menu:Tools[Android>SDK Manager] or the _SDK Manager_ icon in the toolbar of Android Studio to open the Android SDK manager.

In the Android SDK manager select the version of desired Android version the tree and press the btn:[Install] button. 
The following screenshot shows the selection for the _API 18_ version of Android.

Press the btn:[OK] button to start he installation.
		
The _SDK Platforms_ tab is used to install API versions, which the _SDK Tools_ is used to install the development tools.


=== Debug certificate and expire date

(((Debug certificate)))
(((Debug certificate)))
Android applications must be signed before they can get installed on an Android device. 
During development the Android tooling signs the application automatically with a self-signed certificate called the _debug key_.


This debug certificate has an expiration date of 365 days from its creation date.
When the certificate expires, you will get a build error that the certificate has been expired.


To fix this problem, delete the _debug.keystore_ file.
The default storage location is:

* _~/.android/_ on OS X and Linux
* _C:\Documents andSettings\[username]\.android\_ on Windows XP
* _C:\Users\[username]]\.android\_ on Windows Vista and Windows 7.

If this debug key is missing or deleted, it is generated by the tools.
