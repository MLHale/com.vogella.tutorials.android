== Installation of Android Studio

=== System requirements

Development for Android can be done on a reasonably sized computer. 
For a nice experience a modern computer is recommended, for example, a 2.6 GHz CPU with at least 8 GB of memory. 
An SSD speeds up the  start of the Android emulator significantly.
		
=== Requirements for using Linux
		
The Android SDK is 32-bit, therefore on a 64-bit Linux system you need to have the package `ia32-libs` installed. 
For Ubuntu you can do this via the following command.

[source,console]
----
apt-get install ia32-libs
----
		
Please check your distribution documentation if you are using a different flavor of Linux.
