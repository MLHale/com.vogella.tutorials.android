== Exercise: Influence view layout at runtime

In this exercise you add radio buttons the layout of the application you created in <<androidstudio_starter>>. 
Depending on the user selection the radio button arrangement changes from horizontal to vertical.

=== Add radio group and radio buttons to your layout

Open your layout file and add a radio group with two radio buttons to your layout.


Assign them based on the following table.

.ID Assignment
|===
|ID|View

|orientation
|Radio Group

|horizontal
|First radio button

|vertical
|Second radio button
|===


The resulting layout file
should be similar to
the
following
listing.
Note: Only the
`RadioGroup`
part is new.


[source,xml]
----
include::res/exercise_radiogroup/textlayout.txt[]
----


The resulting layout should look like the following screenshot.

=== Change radio group orientation dynamically

Change the
`onCreate()`
method in your
activity. Use the
`findViewById()`
method to find the
`RadioGroup`
in your layout.



Implement a listener on the radio group
which changes the
orientation of the radio buttons based on the
current
selection of the
buttons. Which button is selected, can be
identified by the ID
parameter.

[TIP]
====

`RadioGroup` allows you to add a `RadioGroup.OnCheckedChangeListener` from the `android.widget.RadioGroup` package via the  setOnCheckedChangeListener()` method. 
This listener is notified if the selection of the radio group changes.

You can use the following code as template to implement the listener.

[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_radiogroup/listener.txt[]
----
====

=== Validating
Run your application and select the different radio button.
Ensure that the orientation of the buttons is changed based on your selection.
