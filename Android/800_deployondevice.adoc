== Deployment
=== How to deploy
In general there are restrictions how to deploy an Android
application to your device. You can deploy the application via USB in
test mode onto your device, email yourself the
application or use one
of the many Android markets to install the
application. The following
description highlights the most common
ones.

=== Defining software and hardware requirements for the application


The application can define via a <uses-feature> declaration in the manifest file define which hardware of software
features is requires. Via the
`android:required`
property the application can define if such a feature is required for
the application to work correctly (true) or if
application prefers to
use the feature if present on the device, but
that it is designed to
function without the specified feature, if
necessary.

Examples for such definitions are the presence of a certain
hardware sensor or the availability of a camera.

For an overview of the available restrictions see http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element.html.

=== Signing your application for the release

Android applications must be signed before they can get installed
on an Android device. During development the build process signs the
application automatically with a debug key.

To install the Android application via another channel you need
to sign the Android apk with a self-created signature key.

Please note that you need to use the same signature key in
Google Play (Google Market) to update your application. If you lose
the key, you will NOT be able to update your application ever again.

Make sure to backup your key.

=== Export your application via Android Studio

Use the menu:Build[Generate Signed APK...]
menu entry to start the export from Android Studio.


=== Export your application via the Eclipse IDE

If you want to export your production application via the Eclipse
IDE, you
can right-click on it and select menu:Android Tools[Export Signed Application Package].

This wizard allows to use an existing key or to create a new
one.


=== Via external sources

Android also allows to install applications directly. Just click
on a
link which points to an
_.apk_
file, e.g., in an email attachment
or on a webpage. Android will
prompt you if you want to install this
application.

This requires a setting on the Android device which allows the
installation of non-market application. Typically this setting can
be
found under the "Security" settings.

=== Google Play (Market)

Google Play requires a one time fee, currently 25 Dollar. After
that
the developer can directly upload his application and the required
icons, under
https://play.google.com/apps/publish[Google Play Publishing].


Google performs some automatic scanning of applications, but no
approval process is in place. All application, which do not contain
malware, will be published. Usually a few minutes after upload,
the
application is
available.
