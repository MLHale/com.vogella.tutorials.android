== Using Android devices for testing

=== Using a real Android device for testing

To use a normal Android device, connect your device to your development machine (via USB).
On your Android device turn on _USB Debugging_. 
Select menu:Settings[Development Options], then enable the _USB-Debugging_ option.

You may also need to install the driver for your mobile phone.
Linux and Mac OS usually work out of the box while MS Windows typically requires the installation of a driver.

[NOTE]
====
Of course, the minimum Android version of your Android application needs to fit to the Android version on your device.
====

If you have several devices connected to your computer, you can select which one should be used. 
If only one device is connected, the application is automatically deployed on this device.


=== Using the Android emulator and Android Virtual Device

==== What are Android Virtual Device?

The Android tooling contains an Android device emulator.
This emulator can be used to run an _Android Virtual Device_ (AVD).

These AVDs allow you to test your applications on selected Android devices without access to the real hardware.
Virtual devices give you the possibility to test your application for selected Android versions and a specific configurations.
Even if you have a physical Android device available, you should get familiar with the creation and usage of AVDs.


During the creation of your AVD you define the configuration for the virtual device.
This includes, for example, the resolution, the Android API version and the density of your display.

You can define multiple AVDs with different configurations and start them in parallel. 


[NOTE]
====
If you stop and AVD during startup process the AVD might get corrupted. 
The first start may take long, e.g., several minutes on an older machine.
On a modern machine it typically takes less than a minute for a new AVD to start.
====

After the AVD has started, you can control the GUI with the mouse.
The emulator also provides access to the phone buttons via a menu on the right side of the emulator.

Once started, don't stop the AVD during your development.
If you change your application and want to test a new version, you simply re-deploy your application on the AVD.


==== Google vs. Android AVD

An AVD created for Android contains the programs from the _Android Open Source Project_.
An AVD created for the Google API's contains additional Google specific code.

AVDs created for the Google API allow you to test applications which use Google Play services, e.g., the new Google maps API or the new location services.

==== Speed optimization with GPU rendering

During the creation of an emulator you can choose if you either want _Snapshot_ or _Use Host GPU_ enabled.

[NOTE]
====
The dialog implies that you can select both options, but if you do, you get an error message that these options can not be selected together.
====

If you select the _Snapshot_ option, the second time you start the device it is started very fast, because the AVD stores its state if you close it. 
If you select _Use Host GPU_ the AVD uses the graphics card of your host computer directly which makes the rendering on the emulated device much faster.

==== Speed optimization with the Intel system image

It is possible to run an AVD with an image based on the ARM CPU architecture or based on the Intel CPI architecture.

An Android virtual device which uses the Intel system image is much faster in execution on Intel / AMD hardware compared to the ARM based system image. 
This is because the emulator does not need to translate the ARM CPU instructions to the Intel / AMD CPU on your computer.

NOTE: An Intel image is not available for all API levels.

==== Installation of the Intel emulator on Windows

At the time of this writing your also need to download and install extra drivers for MS windows.

After the download you find the driver in your Android installation directory in the _extras/intel_ folder. 

You need to install the drivers by running the .exe file.

[WARNING]
====
This additional installation step is required on Window to accelerate the Intel emulator.
Only downloading the driver via the Android does not make a difference.
====

After the installation, you can create a new AVD based on the Intel emulator. 
The emulator does start faster and is way faster during the execution of your Android application.

==== Installation of the Intel emulator on Linux

Linux requires a more complex setup. 
For a detailed installation description see the https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager[Intel emulator installation guide] which also includes detailed instructions for Windows.
