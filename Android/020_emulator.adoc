== Using Android Virtual Devices or real devices for testing

=== Android emulator and Android Virtual Device

The Android tooling contains an Android device emulator. 
This emulator can be used to run an _Android Virtual Device_ (AVD), which emulates a real Android phone.

AVDs allow you to test your Android
applications on different
Android
versions and
configurations without
access to the
real hardware.
Even if you have a
real
Android device available, you
should get
familiar with the
creation and
usage of
AVDs. Virtual devices give you
the possibility
to test
your
application for selected Android versions
and a specific
configurations.



During the creation of your AVD you define the configuration for
the virtual device. This includes, for
example,
the resolution, the
Android API version and the
density of your display.


You can
define multiple AVDs with
different
configurations
and start
them in parallel. This allows you to test
different device
configurations at once.


[NOTE]
====
If you stop and AVD during startup
process the AVD might get
corrupted. The first start may take up
to 10 minutes
on an older
machine.
On a modern machine it typically takes 1-3 minutes for a new
AVD to
start.
====

After the AVD has started, you can control the GUI with
the
mouse.
The
emulator also provides access to the phone
buttons via a
menu on
the
right side of the emulator.

Once started,
don't stop the AVD during your development. If you
change your
application and want to test a new
version, you simply
re-deploy
your
application
on the AVD.


=== Debug certificate and expire date
(((Debug certificate)))
(((Debug certificate)))
Android applications must be signed before they can get
installed
on an
Android device. During development Eclipse signs
your
application
automatically with a self-signed certificate called the
_debug key_.


This debug certificate has an expiration date of 365 days from
its creation date. When
the certificate expires,
you will get a build
error that the certificate has been expired.


To fix this
problem, delete the
_debug.keystore_
file. The
default
storage
location is in
_~/.android/_
on OS X and Linux,
in
_C:\Documents andSettings\[username]\.android\_
on Windows XP, and in
_C:\Users\[username]]\.android\_
on Windows Vista and Windows 7.

The next time you
build, the build tools will regenerate a new
keystore and debug key.

=== Google vs. Android AVD


During the creation of an AVD you decide if
you want to create an
Android
device or a
Google device.


An AVD created for Android contains the programs from the _Android Open Source Project_.
An AVD created for the Google API's contains additional Google
specific code.

AVDs created for the
Google API allow you to test applications
which use Google Play services, e.g., the new
Google maps API or the
new
location services.



=== Speed optimization with GPU rendering

During the creation of an emulator you can choose if you either want
_Snapshot_
or
_Use Host GPU_
enabled.

[NOTE]
====
The dialog implies that you can select both options, but if you
do, you get an error message that these options
can not be selected
together.
====

If you select the
_Snapshot_
option, the second time you start the device it is started very fast,
because the AVD stores its state if you close
it. If you select
_Use Host GPU_
the AVD uses the graphics card of your host computer directly which
makes the
rendering on the emulated device much
faster.

=== Speed optimization with the Intel system image

It is possible to run an AVD with an image based on the ARM CPU
architecture or based on the Intel CPI
architecture.

An Android virtual device which uses the Intel system image is
much faster in
execution on Intel / AMD hardware
compared to the ARM
based system image. This is because the emulator
does not need to
translate the ARM CPU instructions
to the Intel / AMD
CPU on your
computer.


The Intel image for an API can be installed via the Android SDK Manager. In Android Studio this happens
automatically if you create an device. If is possible to
configure this via the package details.

NOTE: An Intel image is not available for all API levels.

At the time of this writing your also need to download and
install
extra drivers for MS windows.

After the download you find the driver
in your Android installation
directory in the
_extras/intel_
folder. You need to install the drivers by running starting the
.exe
file.
This additional installation step is required on Window to
accelerate the
Intel emulator. Only downloading the
driver via the
Android does not make a
difference.


After the download you can create a new AVD based on the Intel
emulator. The emulator does not start faster but
is way faster during
the execution of your Android application.

[TIP]
====
Linux requires a more complex setup. For a detailed installation
description see the Intel emulator installation guide (https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager) which also includes detailed instructions for Windows.

=== Using a real Android device for testing

Turn on
_USB Debugging_
on your device in the settings. Select menu:Settings[Development Options], then enable the
_USB-Debugging_
option.


You may
also need to install the driver for
your mobile phone.
Linux and Mac OS usually work out of the box while
Windows
typically
requires the installation of a driver.


For details on the driver installation on Windows
please see http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html.

[NOTE]
====
The minimum Android version of your Android application needs
to fit to the Android version on your device.
====

If you have several devices connected to your computer, you can
select which one should be
used. If only one
device is connected, the
application is automatically deployed on this device.
