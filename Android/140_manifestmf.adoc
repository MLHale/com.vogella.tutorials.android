== The Android manifest
=== Configuration of your Android application
		
The components, settings and metadata of an Android application are described in the _AndroidManifest.xml_ file. 
This file is known as the _manifest file_ or the _manifest_.
		
		
All activities, services and content provider components of the
application
must be statically declared in this
file.
Broadcast receiver
can be defined statically in the manifest file or dynamically at
runtime in the application. This
file is read by the Android system during installation of
the application. The Android system evaluates this configuration file
and determines the capabilities of the application.
		
The Gradle build system for building and packaging Android application can modify the manifest file. 
For example, the  application version is typically supplied by the Gradle build file.
		

=== Android manifest example
		
The following listing shows an example for a simple Android manifest file.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/manifest/AndroidManifest.xml[]

=== Version and package

The `package` attribute defines the base package for the Java objects referred to in this file. 
If a Java object lies within a different package, it must be declared with the full qualified package name.


Google Play
requires that every Android application uses its
own
unique package name.
Therefore
it is a good habit to
use
your
reverse
domain
name here. This
will
avoid
collisions with other
Android
applications.


`android:versionName`
and
`android:versionCode`
specify the
version of your application.
`versionName`
is what the user sees and
can be any string.


`versionCode`
must be an integer. The Android
Market determines
whether it should
perform an update of the applications for the
existing
installation
based on that
`versionCode`.
You
typically
start
with "1" and
increase this value by
one if
you
roll-out
a
new
version
of your
application.

=== Application and components

The `<application>` section allows to define metadata for your application and optionally define an explicit application class. 
It is also a container for declaring other Android components.


The `<activity>` tag defines an activity. 
The `name` attribute points to class, which (if not fully qualified) is relative to the package defined in the`package` attribute.


The _intent filter_ part in the Android manifest file, tells the Android runtime that
this activity should be registered as a possible
entry point into the
application and made available in the launcher of the Android system.

The action defines that it (
`android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"
`
) can be started. 
The `category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"` parameter tells the Android system to add the activity to the launcher.


The `<@string/app_name>` value refers to resource files which contain the actual value of the application name. 
The usage of a resource file
makes it easy to
provide
different
resources
(e.g., strings, colors,
icons) for different
devices
and makes it easy
to
translate
applications.


Similar to the `<activity>` tag, you can use the service, receiver and provider to declare other Android components.


=== Minimum and target SDK

The `uses-sdk` section in the manifest allows you to specify the `minSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` version of your application.

.Minimum and target version
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Value | Description

| minSdkVersion
| Define the minimum version of Android your application works on. 
This attribute is used as a filter in applications stores Play. 
A user cannot install your application on a device with a  lower API level than specified in this attribute.


|targetSdkVersion
|Specifies the version on which you tested and developed.
If it is not equal to the API version of the
Android device,
the Android
system might apply forward- or backward-compatibility
changes. It is good practice to
always set this to the
latest Android API version to take advantages of changes in the
latest Android
improvements.
|===

=== Permissions

The Android manifest file must also contain the
required
permissions for
the
application.
For
example, if
the
application requires
network access,
it
must be
specified
here.


Your application can declare permissions with the
`<permission>`
tag and declare that it required a permission with the
`<uses-permission>`
tag.

Certain permissions, like network access, are granted automatically on Android 6.0 or higher systems. Other
permissions must be confirmed by the users to become active.

=== Required device configuration

The
`uses-configuration`
section in the manifest allows you to specify required input methods
for your device. For example, the following
snippet would
require that
the device has a hardware keyboard.


[source,xml]
----
include::res/manifest/useconfiguration.xml[]
----


The `uses-feature` section allows you to specify the required hardware configuration
for your
device. For example, the following snippet
would
require that
the
device
has a camera.
    
[source,xml]
----
include::res/manifest/usefeature.xml[]
----   

=== Installation location

Via the
`installLocation`
attribute of your application you can specify if your application can
be installed on the external storage of the
device. Use
`auto`
or
`preferExternal`
to permit this.


In reality this option is rarely used, as an application
installed on the external storage is stopped once the
device is
connected to a computer and mounted as USB storage.
