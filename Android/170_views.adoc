== Android views - UI Widgets
	
A _view_ in Android represents a widget, e.g., a button, or a layout manager.
The Android SDK provides standard
views (widgets), e.g., via the `Button`, `TextView`, `EditText` classes.
It also includes complex widgets, for example, `ListView`.
	
All views in Android extend the `android.view.View` class. 
This class is relatively large (more than 18 000 lines of code) and provides a lot of base functionality for subclasses.
	

	
The main packages for views are part of the `android.view` namespace for all the base classes and `android.widget` for the default widgets of the Android platform.
