== Exercise: Using resources in XML files and in code
=== Add images to your application
		
In this exercise you continue to use the existing application.
Create two new images to your project called _ic_tethering_ and _ic_offline_.
		
=== Add views to your project
		
Open your layout file and add a new `Button` and an `ImageView` to it.
Assign the ic_offline file to your `ImageView`, via your layout file as demonstrated in the following XML snippet.

[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_resourceloading/assignimage.xml[]
----
		

=== Replace images via button click
		
If the button is clicked, use the `findViewById()` to search for the `ImageView`.
Use its `setImageResource()` method
to assign the png file (which is represented at runtime via a
`Drawable`
object)
to your
`ImageView`.
The parameter of the
`setImageResource()`
method is the
`R`
reference to your file, e.g.,
`R.drawable.your_png_file`.
		
=== Validating
Ensure that if you press your new button, the displayed image is replaced.
