=== Install support library

The support library allows you to use functionality provided by higher Android releases in lower Android versions.
It also contains functionality that is unbundled from Android, for example the `RecyclerView` widget for efficient list display.
		

Android currently has several versions of the library, the v4, v7 and v13 version. 
These are valid as of the respective API level of Android. 
For example, the support library v7 works as of Android devices with version API 7.
Higher versions of the support library require also the lower versions to work. 
For example, support the v7 library requires the v4 library.
