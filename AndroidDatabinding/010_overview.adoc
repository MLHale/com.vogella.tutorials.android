== Android data binding

=== Introduction to data binding in Android

Android offers support to write declarative layouts using data binding.
This minimizes the necessary code in your application logic to connect to the user interface elements.

To use data binding, Android Plugin for Gradle 1.5.0 or higher is required.

To enable the usage of data binding in your Android application, add the following snippet to the app/build.gradle file.
			
[source,gradle]
----
android {
    ....
    dataBinding {
        enabled = true
    }
}
----

The data binding information is added to your layout files.
During the build process this information is and _Binding_ classes are generated based on its information.
By default, the name of the Binding class is generated based on the name of the layout file. 
It converts the name to Pascal case and adds the “Binding” suffix to it. 
For example, if the layout file is called activity_main.xml, the generate class is called `ActivityMainBinding`. 
This class holds all the bindings from the layout properties, i.e., the defined variable to the corresponding views. 
It also knows how to assign values for the binding expressions.
		
Layout files which supports data binding start with a _layout_ root tag followed by a _data_ element and a _view_ root element. 
This view element is what your root would be in a non-binding layout file. 
The data elements describe data which is available for binding, expressions within the layout are written in the attribute properties using the “@{}” syntax.
		
A sample file looks like the following listing.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/main_layout.xml[]
----
		
The user variable within data describes a property that may be used within this layout.

=== Data binding for events
		
Events may be bound to handler methods directly, similar to the way `android:onClick` can be assigned to a method in the activity. 
Event attribute names are governed by the name of the listener method with a few exceptions. 
For example, `View.OnLongClickListener` has a `method onLongClick()`, so the attribute for this event is `android:onLongClick`.
		
To assign an event to its handler, use a normal binding expression, with the value being the method name to call. 
The binding expression can assign the click listener for a View.

=== Updating the user interfaces with changes from the data model

Any plain old Java object (POJO) can be used for data binding, but modifying such a Java object will not cause the UI to update.
To enable this, the data objects must be able to notify about data changes. 
There are three different data change notification mechanisms, Observable objects, observable fields, and observable collections.

Android provides the `BaseObservable` class which you can extend.
The data class is responsible for notifying when the properties change. 
This is done by assigning a `@Bindable` annotation to the getter and notifying in the setter.

[source,java]
----
package com.vogella.android.databinding;


import android.databinding.BaseObservable;
import android.databinding.Bindable;

import java.util.Observable;

public class TemperatureData extends BaseObservable {
    private String celsius;

    public TemperatureData(String celsius) {
        this.celsius = celsius;
    }

    @Bindable	 	                     <1> 
    public String getCelsius() {
        return celsius;
    }

    public void setCelsius(String celsius) {
        this.celsius = celsius;
        notifyPropertyChanged(BR.celsius);         <2> 
    }
}
----

<1> Define a relevant getter
<2> Notify any listeners, BR.celsius is a generated class


This listener is invoked on every update and it updates the corresponding views. 
This ensures that updates in the model updates also the UI.
				

=== Example for using data binding
	
Layout files which supports data binding start with a _layout_ root tag followed by a _data_ element and a _view_ root element. 
This view element is what your root would be in a non-binding layout file. 
The data elements describe data which is available for binding, expressions within the layout are written in the attribute properties using the `“@{}”` syntax.
	
A sample file looks like the following listing.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/main_layout.xml[]
----
	
The user variable within data describes a property that may be used within this layout.

The data object used with this layout may look like the following listing.

	
[source,java]
----
include::res/User.java[]
----
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/usage.java[]
