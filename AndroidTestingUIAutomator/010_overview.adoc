== Cross-component blackbox user interface testing

=== Using UI Automator for cross component testing

Functional or black-box user interface testing does test the
complete application and not single components of
your application.

The Android SDK contains the
_uiautomator_
Java library for creating user interface tests and provides an engine
to run these user interface tests. Both tools
require
Android 4.3 (API level 18) on the device that is used for testing.

Androids uiautomator provides the
`UiDevice`
class to communicate with the device, the
`UiSelector`
class to search for elements on the screen and the
`UiObject`
which presents user interface elements and is created based on the
`UiSelector`
class. The
`UiCollection`
class allows to select a number of user interface elements at the
same time and
`UiScrollable`
allows to scroll in a view to find an element.
	
=== Accessing the view information with uiautomatorviewer

Android provides the
_uiautomatorviewer_
tool, which allows you to analyze the user interface of an
application. You can use this tool to find the index, text
or
attribute of the application.

This tool allows non-programmers to analyze an application and
develop tests for it via the
_uiautomator_
library. It is depicted in the following screenshot.

To launch the uiautomatorviewer tool, switch on the command line to the android-sdk/tools/ directory and start
the tool via uiautomatorviewer.
