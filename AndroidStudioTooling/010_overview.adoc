== Introduction to Android Studio

=== Introduction to Android Studio
Android Studio is currently the IDE promoted by Google for Android development. 
It is based on IntelliJ and is basically a fork of its code base with additional Android development capabilities added.
		
=== The Android Studio toolbar
The Android Studio toolbar contains several entries which are specific for Android development

=== Storage of the Android project
		
Android Studio stores the projects by default in the home folder of the user under _AndroidStudioProjects_.
		
		
The main directory contains configuration files for Android Studio and the Gradle build files. The application
relevant files are
contained in the
_app_
folder and the most interesting files are contained in the
_src_
folder. This structure is depicted in the following screenshot.

[NOTE]
====
Android Studio puts a virtual view on these files, e.g., it groups the resource files under a common node. 
This view is not identical with the file structure.

=== Opening new projects / switching between projects
		
Android Studio displays different projects in a different window. You can select menu:File[Open...] to open an existing project. 
This opens a new window with this project.
		
		
Alternative you can close the current project via menu:File[Close Project]. and create a new one or open an existing project.
		
=== Clean build / synchronizing the project with Gradle
		
Unfortunately the build functionality in Android Studio sometimes fails to recognize that a resource has changed.
If you want to trigger manually a full rebuild, select menu:Build[Clean Project] to perform a clean build with Gradle.
		
		
Changes in the Gradle build file, require manual intervention.
To synchronize your project with Gradle, use menu:Tools[Android>Sync Project with Gradle Files] or press the corresponding hyperlink in the tooltip of the Gradle build file editor.
		
=== Updating settings for Android Studio

		
Android Studio is provided in different flavors, the user can select if he want to use a stable version or test out
recent features.

* Canary channel: Canary builds are the bleeding edge, released about weekly. While these builds do get tested,
they are still
subject to bugs, as we want people to see what's new as soon as possible. This is not recommended
for production.
* Dev channel: Dev builds are hand-picked older canary builds that survived the test of time. It should be
updated roughly
bi-weekly or
monthly.
* Beta channel: When we reach a beta milestone for the next version of Android Studio, we post the beta builds
here. When the
version is
stable, the beta channel contains the stable version until the next version's beta.
* Stable channel: Contains the most recent stable version of Android Studio.

=== Using a proxy with Android Studio
		
You can use Android Studio and Gradle behind a proxy. For this you have to enter it via menu:File[Settings...].
Android Studio updates also the setting for Gradle to use this proxy. This works better as of Android Studio 1.4.

=== Android Device Monitor
(((Android Device Monitor in Android Studio)))	

Android Studio allows to open the Android Device Monitor via the toolbar or via the menu:Tools[Android>Android Device Monitor]. menu.
	
This starts an Eclipse based application called _Android Device Monitor_ for interacting with your Android (virtual) device and your Android application.
