== Communication with services

=== Options for communication

There are several possibilities for an
activity
to communicate
with
a
service
and vice versa. This section discusses the possible
approaches and provides
recommendation which to use.

=== Using Intent data

In a simple scenario no direct communication is required.
The
service
receives the intent data from the starting Android component
and performs its work. No notification is necessary. For example, in
case the service updates a content provider, the activity is notified
by the content provider and no extra step in the service is
necessary. This approach works for local and services running in
their own process.

=== Using receiver

You can also use broadcast events and registered receivers for
the
communication.
For example, your
activity
can dynamically register a
broadcast receiver for an event
and the
service
sends outs corresponding
events. This is a very typical scenario, in which the service need to
signal to the activity that his processing has finished.

This communication flow is depicted in the following graphic.

TIP: Android provides the `LocalBroadcastManager`
class in the support library v4. This is a helper class to register
for
and send broadcasts of Intents to local objects within your
process. This approach improves security as the broadcast events
are only visible within your process and is faster than using
standard events.

This approach works for local and services running in their own
process.

=== Activity binding to local service

If the
service
is started in the same process as the
activity, the
activity
can directly bind to the service. This is a relatively simple
and
efficient way to communicate and recommended for activities
which need to have a fast communication layer with the service.

This approach works for local services.

=== Handler and ResultReceiver or Messenger

If the service should be communicating back to the
activity,
it can
receive an object of type
`Messenger`
via the
`Intent`
data it receives from the
activity. If the
`Messenger`
is bound to a
`Handler`
in the
activity,
the
`service`
can send objects of type
`Message`
to the
activity.

A
`Messenger`
is parcelable, which means it can be passed to another process and
you
can use this object to send
`Messages`
to the
`Handler`
in the
activity.

`Messenger`
also provides the method
`getBinder()`
which allows passing a
`Messenger`
to the
activity. The
activity
can therefore send
`Messages`
to the
service.

This approach works for local services running in their own
process.

=== AIDL for services in a different process

To bind to a
service
which runs in a different process, you need to use
Inter Process
Communication (IPC) as the data needs to be sent between
different
processes. To do so, you need to create a AIDL file which
looks
similar to a Java interface, but ends with the
_.aidl_
file extension
and is only allowed to extend other AIDL files.

This approach is required if you need to bind to a service
running in
another process, i.e., if your service is consumed by other
Android applications.

You can find more information about this approach in the

Android developer documentation about AIDL.
