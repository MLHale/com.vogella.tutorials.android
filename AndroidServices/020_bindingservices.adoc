== Binding services

=== Binding to services from activities
		
If the
activity
wants to
interact with the
service directly,
it can use
the
`bindService()`
method to start the
_service_.
		
This method requires a
`ServiceConnection`
object as a parameter which is called on the service start and when finishing its
`onBind()`
method. This method
returns a
`IBinder`
object to the
`ServiceConnection`.
		
This
`IBinder`
object
can be used
by the
activity
to communicate
with the
service.
		
When the binding process has finished, the
`onStartCommand()`
method in the service is called with the
`Intent`
object used for the
`bindService()`
method.
		
=== Local services bindings
		
If the service runs in the same process as the activity, it is
possible to return the service to the activity. This allows that the
activity can call methods of the service directly. This technique is
demonstrated by <<exercise_bindlocalservice" />.
		
=== Interprocess communication services bindings
		
If the service run in its own process, you require IPC
(Interprocess
Communication) to communicate with the service.
