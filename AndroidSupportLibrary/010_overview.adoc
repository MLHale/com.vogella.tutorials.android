== Using the support libraries from Google

=== What are the support libraries

The Android Support Library package is a set of code libraries that provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs.
They also provide features and widgets that are only available through the library APIs. 
Each support library is backward-compatible to a specific Android API level.

In general you find two types of support libraries. 
The first type provides framework functionality for older API releases, the second type provides new functionality for all devices. This functionality is either net yet part of the
platform or will never be part of the platform, so that Google can continue to improve it faster than Android platform
API.

=== The support libraries from Google
	
You have different components here. At the time of this writing you
have:

== Remove usage of the support library from a new project

=== Why would you remove the support library?
		
Support libraries are changing very fast therefore it is hard to create a "stable" description how to use them.
Also unfortunately the templates of Android studio for generating Android projects are changing all the time.
This make testing a new feature or standard API harder.
It also makes it harder to follow a tutorial.
		
	
=== Converting a project to a standard Android project

The build dependency in the Gradle build file does not hurt but you need to remove the references to the
compatibility library from your code and your resources.
		
		
For this, change the code of the generated activity to extend `Activity` instead of any other activity like `AppCompatActivity`. 
Also, reduces the example code to the minimum. 
The following is an example for an activity called `MainActivity`.

[source,java]
----
include::res/compat/MainActivity.java[]
----		

Also ensures that only standard elements are using the generated layout file. 
The following is an example listing for a simple standard layout file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/compat/activity_main.xml[]
----
		
Also ensure that the theme is a default theme, instead of the compatibility theme. 
For this check the _app/res/values/styles.xml_ folder to use the standard material theme.
