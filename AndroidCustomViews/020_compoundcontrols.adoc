== Compound Views

Compound views (also known as _Compound Components_ ) are  pre-configured `ViewGroups` based on existing views with some predefined view interaction.

Combound views also allow you to add custom API to update and query the state of the combound view.


For such a control you define a layout file and assign it to your compound view. 
In the implementation of your compound view you
predefine the
view
interaction.
You would define a layout file and extend
the corresponding
`ViewGroup`
class. In this class you inflate the layout file and implement the
`View`
connection logic

[TIP]
====
For performance reasons you may want to rewrite your combound
view to
a custom view which extends
`View`. This may you can typically flatten your view hierarchy. Drawing the
view requires in this case less traversals and this can be
significantly faster if implemented correctly.
