== Building different flavors of your Android applications
 
=== Build types and build flavors
		
Android uses by default two build types: _debug_ and _release_.
For these build types you can create different flavors in you Gradle build.
	
The Gradle build system is also able to manage different flavors of an application.
A product flavor defines a customized version of the application. 
This allows that some parts of the codebase or the resources can be different for variations of the app. 
	
For instance, you can define different build variants for certain device categories, like phone or tablet. 
Another use case might be a paid or a free version of your app.
Or you want to use different resources or classes during a test run.
	
=== Defining product flavors in your Gradle build file
		
You can use the  `productFlavors` closure of you _app/build.gradle_ file to define different variants of your product.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/gradle/productFlavours.build[]
----
	
		
The whole _build.gradle_ file might look like the following:

[source,shell]
----
include::res/gradle/productFlavours_complete.build[]
----
		
After defining these flavors you can select them in the _Build Variants_ view in Android Studio.

=== Providing different resources for the flavors
		
In order to define a different behavior for a certain flavor, you need to create suitable folders for the defined flavors under _app/src/_.
	
Flavor specific resources override the main resources.
For example, if you provide a different application icon in a flavor the Android build system picks up the flavor specific one.
	

=== Providing different source sets for the product flavors

The directories in the src/ folder are called _source sets_. 
Every product flavor can define its own source set.
		
Code files are not replaced as resources, they are combined. 
For example, you cannot have a  `com.example.MainActivity` activity in your _app/main/java/_ folder and a different implementation in another flavor.
If you try this, you receive an error message about duplicate class definitions.
	
You can still provide different implementations by avoiding the creation of the  class in your main source folder and instead create a class in each flavor.
