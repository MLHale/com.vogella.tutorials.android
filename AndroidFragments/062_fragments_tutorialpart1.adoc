== Exercise: Using fragments

The following tutorial demonstrates how to use fragments in a standard Android application.
It does not use the support library.
The application uses different number of fragments depending on portrait and landscape mode.
		
In portrait mode the main activity shows one fragment.
From this fragment the user can navigate to another activity which contains another fragment.
		
In landscape mode the main activity shows both fragments side by side.
		
=== Create Project
	
Create a new Android project with the following data. 
[NOTE]
====
Ensure you Do NOT use the compatibility layer on the last page of the project wizard.
====

.Android project
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Property |Value

|Application Name
|RSS Reader

|Company Domain
|android.example.com

|Package name
|com.example.android.rssreader

|Template
|Empty Activity

|Activity
|RssfeedActivity NOTE This is not the default name

|Layout
|activity_main

|Backward compatibility
|Not selected NOTE: This is not the default selection
====

|===
	
[WARNING]
====
Verify that you activity extends `Activity` to ensure you are not using the backwards compatibility mode.
If you extends another class, delete the project and create it again.
Ensure that you deselect the "Backward Compatibility" flag in the project creation wizard.

=== Create layout files for the fragments
		
Create a new layout file called _fragment_rssitem_detail.xml_ in the _res/layout/_ folder.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/fragments/fragment_rssitem_detail.xml[]
----

NOTE: The id must be correct, the fragment uses this to search for the `TextView`.
		
Create a new layout file called _fragment_rsslist_overview.xml_. 

[source,xml]
----
include::res/fragments/fragment_rsslist_overview.xml[]
----

NOTE: Also here, the id must be correct.
		
=== Create fragment classes
		
Create the follows classes which are used as fragments.
Start with the `DetailFragment` class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/fragments/DetailFragment.java[]
----
		
Create the `MyListFragment` class. 
Despite its name it will not display a list of items. 
Instead it will just have a button which allow to send the current time to the details fragment.

[source,java]
----
include::res/fragments/MyListFragment.java[]
----		
		
		
=== Change the main layout file
		
Change the existing _activity_main.xml_ file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/fragments/activity_main.xml[]
----	
		
=== RssfeedActivity
		
Change the `RssfeedActivity` class so that it can act as call back for the list fragment and update the detailed fragment.

[source,java]
----
include::res/fragments/RssfeedActivity.java[]
----	

NOTE: The tools: tag  is optional. It points to a layout to that the preview in Android Studio can display the fragment.

=== Verify that the application works as expected
		
Start your application.
Both fragments should be displayed both in landscape and portrait mode. 
You can use the emulator controls to change the orientation of the emulator.
If you press the button in  the `ListFragment`, the `DetailFragment` gets updated.
