== Exercise: Use a headless retained fragment to store the state

In this exercise you would like to remember the last selection of the user. 
We use a headless fragment for this.

=== Create headless fragment

[source,java]
----
include::res/headless/SelectionStateFragment.java[]
----

=== Use headless fragment to store the last selected value

[source,java]
----
include::res/headless/RssfeedActivity.java[]
----

=== Define a boolean flag dependent of the resource selector

Create a file in your _res/values_ folder called _config.xml_ with the following setting.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/mode/config.xml[]
----	
	
Create the same file in your _res/values-land_ folder with a different value.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/mode/config2.xml[]
----

=== Adjust the RssfeedActivity activity
		
Adjust the `RssfeedActivity` class to replace the existing fragment in case you are in single pane mode.


[source,java]
----
include::res/fragments/RssfeedActivity2.java[]
----	

<1> This cleanup is necessary because we are using dynamically switching between two fragments and one fragments. 
That is an unusual scenario, typically the selection of one or two fragment is based on the smallest width of a device and does not change at runtime.
The `FragmentManager` caches the fragment to optimize performance, so we need to ensure that we remove an existing detailed fragment.

=== Validate your implementation
		
Test your application. 
If you run the application in portrait mode, you should see only one fragment. 
In horizontal mode you see both fragments.
		
Switch the orientation of the emulator.
Press the button in portrait as well as in horizontal mode and verify that the detail activity shows the current time.
