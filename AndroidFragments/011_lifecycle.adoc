== Fragment life-cycle 

A fragment has its own life cycle. 
But it is always connected to the life cycle of the activity which uses the fragment.

If an activity stops, its fragments are also stopped. 
If an activity is destroyed, its fragments are also destroyed.

|Method |Description

|`onAttach()`
|The fragment instance is associated with an activity
instance.The fragment and the
activity is not fully initialized.
Typically you get in this method a
reference to
the
activity which
uses the fragment for further initialization work.

|`onCreate()`
|Fragment is created. The
`onCreate()`
method is called after the
`onCreate()`
method of the activity but before the
`onCreateView()`
method of the fragment.

|`onCreateView()`
| 
The fragment instance creates its view
hierarchy. In the
`onCreateView()`
method the
fragment
creates its user
interface. Here you can inflate
a layout via
the
`inflate()`
method call of the
`Inflator`
object passed as a parameter to this method.


In this method you should not interactive with the activity,
the activity is not yet fully initialized.

There is no need to
implement this method for headless
`fragments`.The
inflated views become part of the view hierarchy of its
containing
activity.

|`onActivityCreated()`
|The
`onActivityCreated()`
is called after the
`onCreateView()`
method when the host
_activity_
is created.

Activity and fragment instance have been created as
well as
the
view
hierarchy of the activity.
At this point, view can
be accessed with
the
`findViewById()`
method.
example.

In this method you can instantiate objects which require a
`Context`
object.

|`onStart()`
|The
`onStart()`
method is called once the
fragment
gets visible.

|onResume()
|Fragment becomes active.

|`onPause()`
|Fragment is visible but becomes not active anymore, e.g.,
if
another activity is animating on top of the activity which
contains the fragment.

|`onStop()`
|Fragment becomes not visible.

|`onDestroyView()`
|Destroys the view of the fragment. If the fragment is
recreated
from the backstack this method is called and afterwards
the
`onCreateView`
method.

|onDestroy()
|Not guaranteed to be called by the Android platform.
